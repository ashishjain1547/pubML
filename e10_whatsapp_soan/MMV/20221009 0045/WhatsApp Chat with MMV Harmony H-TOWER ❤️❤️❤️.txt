03/09/22, 11:19 pm - +91 84471 99258: Respected Ladies ! 
Our apologies for keeping all of you waiting for results of Rangoli competition. Everyone was so embossed with the programme today that we could not dare interrupting the flow in between. 
The Jury was represented from each tower and the final conclusion was arrived after taking cognisance of each member . 
Believe us : 
1) It was the most difficult task for us , difficult even from our final degree exams. 
2) All Rangolis were made with dedication , hard work , religious & Team spirit . 
3) Each Rangoli was the perfect presentation with different themes and were masterpiece in itself . 
4) Though all presentations were unique and best by itself , but for the sake of spirit of competition the final ranking arrived jointly by the Jury is : 
1) Tower G - Mooshak 
2) Tower F - Lady welcoming lord 
3) Tower H - colour of festivities 
Note : The Wow feeling was the presentation by Tower A , Clean Hands , every minute details were visible and was looking like a colour Print . However, we understand, as per the guidelines issued , it was made clear that the Rangoli should not depict any god . It was otherwise the best presentation. 
Three cheers for all the ladies who despite working tirelessly for morning Pooja and evening programmes , devoted time on these Rangoli presentations . 
Three cheers for all the ladies 🙏🙏

Ganesh chaturthi program is now over & another Planned & announced event "Maata Ki Chouki" is lined up. We are enjoying and looking forward to the same :)

05/09/22, 5:43 pm - +91 77953 40840: In common area lights used to be switched on all over the day. It caused electricity wastage as we don't need electricity during day time.  I feel it is totally worthless to waste electricity.  Can someone raise this issue please? 🙏🏻

05/09/22, 8:32 pm - +91 98370 76788: To all Htower representatives....the occupant of H 2503 has a dog and leaves him loose in the lift lobby. He pees and it stays there. The place stinks as well as it is unhygienic.  Yesterday I requested him about the same and he assured me that it will not happen again. Today it is again there and no one is bothered to clean it. My son came from work and nearly slipped on it. I request you to take appropriate action. Also this person uses the passenger lift instead of the service lift when he takes his dog down. The lift stinks! Yesterday when I told him about this he said that he was not aware of any such rule! Please look into this matter as it is becoming an everyday nuisance!
05/09/22, 8:32 pm - +91 98370 76788: <Media omitted>
05/09/22, 8:47 pm - +91 95829 22894: And whosoever is living in H 2303 and H 2503....pls keep dustbin in your respective houses and throw garbage there only not in our balcony. Every morning we have to pick it up. Its a request this time will not be polite next time.
05/09/22, 8:48 pm - +91 98370 76788: It seems some people do not understand politeness!
05/09/22, 8:51 pm - +91 95829 22894: Agree...we r daily picking thrash hoping some common sense prevails soon..but common sense is not so common
05/09/22, 9:03 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Today I opened another side gates because of the entire lift lobby stinks because of that local street dog on 25th floor . This can create diseases among the owner of that local street dog because the entire body of that dog stinks . Don't want to say anything in this matter to you my neighbor but health and heigine comes first priority . My all guests who came yesterday today morning also said the same of this pathetic smell .
Requesting tower representatives please spend 9 minutes and 9 seconds in 25th floor lobby and you will understand my pain .

Probably let me know since when you've kept it in the kitchen.
06/09/22, 9:13 am - +91 96506 49949: What issue u have been facing..?
06/09/22, 9:15 am - +91 95821 82195: The fan got damaged. The service guy mentioned it's due to Voltage fluctuations while we've Stabilizer already installed on refrigerator. We think may be because of less ventilation space.
06/09/22, 9:16 am - +91 95821 82195: Unable to find any other position to place it, that's why looking for suggestions
06/09/22, 9:22 am - +91 96506 49949: Ohh..sorry not faced any problem so far..it been 10 month now to keep in kitchen..

Sab apni galti cover karnae ke liya excuse .
Kitchen mein itni tez hawa aati so ventilation issue toh nahi hona chaiye
06/09/22, 9:45 am - Harsh Sharma MMV H Tower: Aaj kal inbuild stablizer aate ha  last week only we had  purchased refrigerators that too  big one 415 liters
06/09/22, 9:45 am - +91 97174 95842: Okay

06/09/22, 10:17 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: It is much needed equipment for shifting grocery items from basement to flat
06/09/22, 2:06 pm - +91 95821 82195: Not mandatory but we took it just as a safety measure
06/09/22, 2:06 pm - +91 95821 82195: Great
06/09/22, 2:07 pm - +91 95821 82195: Don't know what it is exactly but I'm bit skeptical to keep it inside and in drawing room cannot find much space as I've to accommodate other furniture
06/09/22, 2:07 pm - +91 95821 82195: That's why thought of asking
06/09/22, 2:08 pm - +91 95821 82195: The size our fridge is around 2'4" by 2'4" around 440 litres
06/09/22, 2:48 pm - Shakti Kalra H12 Mountville: Alert - extended balcony is getting repaired and painted in 01 series... It's always a surprise as per notice it will be done by 31 Aug but today suddenly paint lift came up

06/09/22, 3:09 pm - +91 89055 08481: Is this from our society? Guess not! We don't live in Ghaziabad, right?
Don't see the relevance but thanks still.
06/09/22, 3:12 pm - Shakti Kalra H12 Mountville: Sorry to say but are we waiting for our society name here?? 
we can still see pets in the passenger's Lift... Are we waiting for any incident??

Anyways this was just FYI, you can easily ignore it if you don't find any relevance, thanks 🙏

06/09/22, 3:16 pm - +91 89055 08481: Humans are more dangerous than dog in most cases
Pls ignore if not relevant
06/09/22, 3:17 pm - Shakti Kalra H12 Mountville: I quit maam🙏
06/09/22, 3:21 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV H Tower: Aise kaise shakti bhai 
Aap ki batao mein wajan ha  need your support  🤪🤪🤪🤪
06/09/22, 3:25 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: H2503 main relevance
06/09/22, 3:35 pm - +91 98217 35903: Pets are also part of family and they don’t harm anyone untill they are provoked….i think we all shd deal with them with care and love thats all and there is no harm if they are in passenger lift but leashed
06/09/22, 3:37 pm - +91 89055 08481: And we cannot generalise anyone/anything (even dogs) on the basis of one incident. It's like saying all humans are murderers
06/09/22, 3:38 pm - +91 89055 08481: There is always a 'pre' and a 'post' context in every story.
06/09/22, 3:39 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Agreed with both of you but you both have not yet confronted with H2503 street dog .
06/09/22, 3:39 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Pointers are considered 
1. At least pet should be branded .
2. It should be vaccinated .
06/09/22, 3:40 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: That's it
06/09/22, 3:40 pm - +91 89055 08481: what the hell do you mean by "branded"?
06/09/22, 3:40 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Some breed not local street dog
06/09/22, 3:40 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: I mean
06/09/22, 3:41 pm - +91 89055 08481: wow. I quit sir. can't argue with you. not worth it. have a lovely evening👏🏻
06/09/22, 3:43 pm - Harsh Lohiya H704 MMV GGM: I request you to avoid sharing provocative news articles if it is not applicable here.....every pet is their owner's responsibility and each issue can be taken up personally with respective people

Also completely disagree with your view on street dogs..will connect with you sometime later if you have time. (Labs can be equally aggressive as a fighter dog given the right (wrong) environment to grow)...there is a famous saying when you get a dog...the human needs equal training as a dog does
06/09/22, 3:48 pm - +91 98975 20593: Fo you think it's needed? Already itni Hawa hai
06/09/22, 3:49 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: This message was deleted
06/09/22, 3:49 pm - Harsh Lohiya H704 MMV GGM: Also suggestions to people who encounter difficult dogs:

Please recommend the humans to get the dog trained from good dog schools / trainers and educate themselves also about raising a dog...it's as difficult as raising a kid

Maybe not applicable to all, but usually the pet parent is already under a lot of stress when trying to deal with problemsome dogs in a public area so they should be supported instead of being cornered into giving up the dog

PS - feel free to reach out to me if you need suggestions with good schools / trainer or just want to have a conversation about how some steps that can help
06/09/22, 3:53 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: My main point is 
1. Pet should be mentally stable 
2. It should be vaccinated 
3. It should be hold properly 
4. It should not stinge so proper cleanliness must be taken care 

That's it 
I keep my lobby doors daily because of the same stinge smell .

That's it
06/09/22, 4:40 pm - +91 98719 89782: Akash bhai 
I don't know how this news is provocative. This is a information for dog parents and human parents both. Its really impractical to compare to always compare with Dog and human but believe   me brother that human keep the dog, become pet parents. Dog cant keep human and can become human parents. So better to help each other for peace living in society. Yesterday we encountered with a pets parents but non of pet lover came forward to console him where pet owner has denied to accept his mistake and started fighting with ladies and senior citizen.
06/09/22, 4:44 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Relax everyone and stay calm I sit shortly with Ashish jain bro and discuss the matter and close it 🌪️
06/09/22, 4:45 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: He is also new so need some cooperation from all of us
06/09/22, 4:47 pm - +91 89055 08481: It is also impractical to keep on posting every single news piece related to "how dangerous digs are" Dhirendra Bhai :)
I may not like milk, but doesn't mean I will post articles saying 'how dangerous it is to consume milk' on a group for my peace of mind.
06/09/22, 4:47 pm - Harsh Lohiya H704 MMV GGM: I would really like to understand how the article is helping people live peacefully or helping in any capacity 

Might be impractical to you but difficult dogs and dog issues should be dealt with case by case like difficult humans. I am not advocating for anyone - my problem lies with sharing articles to villainize a group of pet owners. Again pretty sure no one would promote sharing graphic images of murder or rape or news articles here on this group. Rest it's a free platform and by being on it I agree to read and see whatever is posted.
06/09/22, 4:47 pm - Harsh Lohiya H704 MMV GGM: Awesome :)
06/09/22, 4:47 pm - +91 89055 08481: Cooperation is the last thing we have to offer by the looks of it
06/09/22, 4:48 pm - +91 98719 89782: He may be new for this society but maintaining cleanness of nearby area and talking to ladies and senior citizen is basis things which he must learnt in his school time.
06/09/22, 4:49 pm - +91 89055 08481: It is extremely sad how you are signaling out a person. Just shows what we learnt in our school time.
06/09/22, 4:52 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV H Tower: Should have done the same earlier ankit i will accompany you
06/09/22, 4:53 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Literally
06/09/22, 4:54 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: I am his front neighbor H2502 by the way and the first one to ask him for all events for party for ganesh chathurthy for Krishna Janmashtmi etc
06/09/22, 4:55 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Thanks bro I think we should plan a party ☕
06/09/22, 4:56 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Party is the solution of everything 🤣🤣🤣
06/09/22, 4:58 pm - +91 98719 89782: Pet owner should follow the pet policy and we human should follow human policy and problem solved. If pet owners are not ready to accept pet policy then they can contact FMT and get it amendment as per their choice but don't force human to accept their self made rule.
06/09/22, 4:58 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: St Bernard dilwa dete hai ashish bhai ko

06/09/22, 5:00 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Nhi ye koi rakh hi nhi payega itne expenses hai iske dheranderji 🤣🤣🤣
06/09/22, 5:01 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Laghbhag 50k a month
06/09/22, 5:01 pm - Harsh Lohiya H704 MMV GGM: Completely agreed. The discussion wasn't about this at all though but okay 👍
06/09/22, 5:01 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Completely agreed 🤝
06/09/22, 5:02 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Jai Mata Di 🙏🙏🙏
06/09/22, 5:03 pm - +91 98719 89782: Jai Mata di Akash bhai 🙏
06/09/22, 5:21 pm - +91 81302 99111: Sorry to jump in. But we are surely not happy with the existing pet policy. Also I don’t think it just needs to be discussed with FMT .. I think our tower representatives/RWA should also help us in putting that forward. I 100% agree on using service lifts, keeping them leashed and maintain high hygiene so that none of our fellow Tower are faces any issue. 
But we as pet parents also request our fellow tower mates to understand the issues that we are facing. There is no pet designated area inside the society ( Majority of the societies have that) - we already had lots of incident on street dogs attacking  pets, it gets really difficult to take dogs out at night specially for ladies and in rainy season. 
Also I think just because of one incident we should not generalise stuff and should avoid sharing stuff in a common group that might hurt other people sentiments. We are not comparing humans with pets they both are separate. But we aleast need to treat them as living beings.
Also it’s nothing related to a breed,     The nature of the dog depends on how you train them. So we should not say that Indie/street dogs cannot be adopted. In our society we have approx 45+ dogs of all the breeds.
06/09/22, 5:27 pm - +91 89055 08481: I request the Tower reps to pls take this with FMT, Radhika has aptly explained our challenges

06/09/22, 5:29 pm - +91 98719 89782: I also agree that pet area should be within our society  compound and same has been already discussed with builder and FMT but no concrete plan from them. We are working on it and shall revert you all soon.
06/09/22, 5:30 pm - +91 81302 99111: Thank you so much Dhirendra ji 🙏🏻
06/09/22, 5:31 pm - +91 98370 76788: Radhikaji I understand your point but as you said the pet owner should adhere to society rules..
They should also train their pets properly so that others are not inconvenienced due to them. The most important thing is maintaining hygiene. If all these are maintained there will be no need to have this discussion.
06/09/22, 5:36 pm - +91 81302 99111: 100% agree and we do that on our side. If you meet our SIMBA(Labrador) you can see it and m sure you like him Aunty 🙂. It is every pet owner’s basic responsibility and they must adhere to it. Peeing in the lifts or lobby area is not at all acceptable.
06/09/22, 5:40 pm - +91 98370 76788: Now you understand what we go through when such things happen. I'm sure your SIMBA must be trained and cute but I would surely want others to follow a good example too. No offense to anyone but certain things regarding hygiene and safety are just not acceptable. I'm sure every mature and educated person will agree.
06/09/22, 5:43 pm - +91 77953 40840: One request from my side also , my maid who was working on 3200rs per month according to the society fixed price,  today she came and started asking unreasonable demands. 
Is it worth to fulfill all the demands of maid 🤔 I am new to this tower and society please help and suggest 🙏
06/09/22, 8:42 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Madam I suggest tell her to continues working and if she did good work you may increase accordingly because getting a good and reliable maid is also not easy task currently.
06/09/22, 8:51 pm - +91 77953 40840: Hmmm 😕😞

09/09/22, 11:50 am - +91 95821 82195: Just saw a conversation on MyGate that their decorative article been stolen from their Entrance. 
Looking at this, I think we must Have CCTV cameras on each floor as it's a very basic necessity and Residential societies with basic amenities are having CCTV on each floor.
09/09/22, 12:00 pm - +91 70422 40656: +1. Don't think FMT or Builder will agree to this.

In the apartments where I used to live previously, builder had provided camera surveillance on the outer periphery of the building but residents contributed the money & got the cameras installed on every floor with Guard having the live view 24/7. Yearly contribution was taken for annual maintenance.
09/09/22, 12:52 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Electric scanner can be given to each tower guards for proper checking of maids and delivery persons entering and leaving towers
09/09/22, 12:59 pm - +91 74559 09805: There might be probability as guard may miss but cameras installation will be better option I think 🤔
09/09/22, 1:14 pm - +91 95821 82195: I've seen maids using Parking Basement as well for moving from one Tower to another
09/09/22, 2:27 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Yes because we have access controlled basement doors but they ar3 not yet activated if they are activated no one can move here there without access cards
09/09/22, 2:45 pm - +91 98975 20593: All doors are access controlled but none of them is working not sure if they are even going to work in future aswell
09/09/22, 2:46 pm - +91 98975 20593: Camera on each floor seems a good idea given that we have penalties in place which can also compensate for annual cost of camera
09/09/22, 2:51 pm - +91 95821 82195: I believe it's a basic necessity to have the CCTV
09/09/22, 3:17 pm - +91 98975 20593: Basic necessity hi poori nhi ho rhi mapsko me hum logo ki 😂
09/09/22, 3:25 pm - +91 95821 82195: If this can be raised with the concerned Team, it can be done.
09/09/22, 3:35 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV H Tower: Earlier there was a board mentioning visitor and resident not able to see that from past few days lot visitors go to resident row create jam at main gate

Due to my business requirement, now I am bound to travel almost 20-25 days in a month and it is getting very dificult for me to attend any Reps meeting, unable to perform my duty for which I have been nominated by respected H tower residents. So better to nominate any other suitable representative from H who can devote their time.
I shall be always available on any single call by any of mapsko residents  and ready to utilised my resources in favour of our society development and its betterment.
Regards

Kindly do this asap. Blank form 10 can be collected if need from your Tower Rep. Or in case you already hold a copy of your form that you had submitted to Builder please share that alongwith cheque to your Tower Reps.
Thank you all

03/10/22, 1:57 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Rule no 1 - Tenants can't use club and pool amenities unless they have written permission from owerns submitted to RRs and In FMT and the no. of family members of tenant .
03/10/22, 1:57 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Rule no 2 - Maid are strictly not allowed to use any of society events or functions.
03/10/22, 1:59 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Rule No 3 - FIR on maid asap .
03/10/22, 2:01 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: 🙂👍
03/10/22, 2:19 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: How pathetic, unsensible  and cheap act that local  maid/caretaker is using our swimming pool after abiding Clubhouse Rules and bypassing Tower RRs and FMT rules and regulations and how these tenants allowed them to use it . It's a crystal clear matter of hygiene and breaching society rules and regulations . Not tolerable at all... literally . Tenants are from H1202 after checking this maid profile who has appointed her .

03/10/22, 6:58 am - +91 99587 88882: I guess this needs to be circulated to each flat in case they refuse know these rules or break any one of these...
03/10/22, 7:01 am - +91 99587 88882: Although this type of action should not have been required but since such events are happening and even seen this needs to be addressed and actioned a upon without further delay.
03/10/22, 8:14 am - +91 99582 99816: Hi All, We are from H204.
We also take her service for our baby's massage.
She arrives, does her job and leaves. We sit there while she massages our baby.
We haven't found anything suspicious yet. Probably because we are pretty precautious always.
Also, we have never taken her anywhere with us.
03/10/22, 8:52 am - +91 95995 57065: Good morning all.
We are doing Kanya Pooja today between 10:30-11:00 today.
Could you pls send over your lovely daughters to ours H-2004 for 10-15 min? A line of confirmation 1:1 to me will be very helpful 🙏🏼
Look forward. Thank you so much. 🙂
03/10/22, 10:08 am - +91 83840 67456: Anyone have Air Balloon Pump ?
03/10/22, 10:14 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Ok noted ✅
03/10/22, 10:16 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: So than please add her on mygate maid list also as it only shows she works in 2 houses in H and A tower on mygate and submit your rating and review also for her there .
03/10/22, 10:17 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Ok noted ✅
03/10/22, 11:57 am - +91 99582 99816: Sure
03/10/22, 6:18 pm - +91 83840 67456: Is 🐕 allowed in Passenger lift ?
03/10/22, 6:26 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV H Tower: Pls use  service lift service
03/10/22, 6:26 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV H Tower: Only
03/10/22, 6:31 pm - +91 83840 67456: Just to clarify
I was not asking for myself.
I just saw someone using the Passenger lift along with their pet.
We didn't take the lift because we weren't comfortable.
03/10/22, 6:32 pm - +91 96506 49949: As per pet guidelines which are formed by FMt, pet will go by service lift only.
03/10/22, 6:33 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Housing associations cannot ban pets in elevators through notices put up for the purpose. They cannot frame bye-laws framed or amended for the purpose, even with the consent of the general body. If the pets are in leash and with the owner no one can disallow that.
03/10/22, 6:35 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: We always try to use service lifts but the frequency of the lift is a bit slow and even the dog cannot wait for so long, so sometimes people use passenger lift while going down , I shouldn’t think that should be a hurdle to anyone. Mostly pet parents use service lifts only while going up.

03/10/22, 6:37 pm - Ashish Jain: Dogs are families too.
03/10/22, 6:37 pm - +91 83840 67456: And yes right babies can wait but dogs can not
03/10/22, 6:39 pm - +91 96506 49949: Kalpesh, this is request you to follow the defined guidelines which are being followed by most of residents in society..if any changes need you can discuss with fmt directly..pls follow the same..🙏🙏🙏🙏 ..

03/10/22, 6:39 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Apologies mam if you felt it wrong but I am just explaining from my end. Rest is up to you, how you consider it. Even the pet parents are aware about it if a lady is with a small baby, we are more concerned.
03/10/22, 6:40 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Manish Ji, we are following the protocols on case to case basis the things are shown in different ways, I have mentioned above that most of the time we use service lifts only.
03/10/22, 6:41 pm - +91 83840 67456: I am not against any pet animals, but if there is a matter to differentiate between baby and pet animals then definitely I will choose baby first.
03/10/22, 6:44 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: For such instances please take pics for record so that we can inform accordingly to them
03/10/22, 6:44 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV H Tower: Bhai sometimes passenger lift mein bhi time laag jata tab kya karogae so have patience fhir bhi you can ask tower guard why the lift is stuck at one floor.
03/10/22, 6:45 pm - Ashish Jain: Pretty aweful!
Dogs are being compared with babies these days. 🤣🤣🤣
03/10/22, 6:47 pm - +91 83840 67456: Yes someone(pet owner) did this not me.

We are expecting that maid should follow guidelines and what about us?
03/10/22, 6:47 pm - +91 83840 67456: And that owner was from 18th or 20th floor
03/10/22, 6:48 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV H Tower: Apni lift ki take.care hum mein hi  karni hogi
 fmt toh bol dega hum kal clean karenge aaj ki cleaning toh hogai.

03/10/22, 6:49 pm - +91 83840 67456: Right sir, some people are not comfortable with dogs
03/10/22, 6:49 pm - +91 96506 49949: Harsh, Ankit bro ,let's close this here only...residents are enough mature ...pls dnt make it lengthy now...
03/10/22, 6:51 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Ananya ji , please don’t drag it unnecessarily we have already explained the reason above, sometimes on case to case basis owners tend up to use the passenger lifts, it would be better if the conversation ends over here.
03/10/22, 6:52 pm - +91 96506 49949: Thx for understanding..

03/10/22, 6:52 pm - Ashish Jain: Has anyone read this?
03/10/22, 6:55 pm - Ashish Jain: The Handmaid's Tale is a futuristic dystopian novel[6] by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, published in 1985. It is set in a near-future New England, in a strongly patriarchal, totalitarian theonomic state, known as the Republic of Gilead, which has overthrown the United States government.[7] The central character and narrator is a woman named Offred, one of the "handmaids"—a group of women who are forcibly assigned to produce children for the "commanders"—the ruling class of men in Gilead.

03/10/22, 6:56 pm - Ashish Jain: Has anyone read this?
03/10/22, 6:57 pm - Ashish Jain: Nineteen Eighty-Four (also stylised as 1984) is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale written by the English writer George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the totalitarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.[2][3][4] More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated.
03/10/22, 7:02 pm - +91 98370 76788: Ashishji... your story sure is pathetic! Atleast you realize it was your mistake and you were incapable of looking after your Moti. Don't blame people around you for this but look for the fault within you. If I say something I say it with proof....not for just saying. So stop blaming others for your incompetence and try and improve yourself . Its more of hygiene and cleanliness than just blaming others for your own lack of the same. Thanks a lot and hope you have learnt something from your mistakes. I'm sure wherever Moti is he must be fine and in a healthier atmosphere. God looks after each and everyone and will surely look after him too. 🙏

03/10/22, 7:05 pm - Ashish Jain: Has anyone read this?
03/10/22, 7:06 pm - Ashish Jain: Lord of the Flies is a 1954 novel by the Nobel Prize-winning British author William Golding. The plot concerns a group of British boys who are stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempts to govern themselves. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality.
03/10/22, 7:19 pm - +91 99582 99816: This can't be done Ankit ji. Probably shouldn't be done unless it is utmost necessary.
We don't want to hurt anyone's sentiments, but we should also understand that guidelines are there for healthy and happening environment. Chaos won't take us anywhere.

Peace out 🤞🏻

03/10/22, 7:29 pm - Ashish Jain: "My Land and My People" tells the story of the Dalai Lama's life, as well providing a history of the shocking subjugation of the Tibetan people by the Chinese government. Rather than being an angry indictment, however, the book instead issues a gentle appeal for understanding and peace.

03/10/22, 9:02 pm - Ashish Jain: How to revitalize a neighborhood -- without gentrification
The housing market can be vexing: while some neighborhoods get ridiculously expensive and price out longtime residents, others have historic homes sitting vacant without demand. Equitable housing developer and TED Fellow Bree Jones shares how she found a way to revitalize neighborhoods experiencing hyper-vacancy while preventing gentrification -- supporting home buyers and transforming communities along the way.

I have gone to tower C also because some handicapped person is there and won't able to come and sign it . Don't you won't elections would be conducted in society . I have just came because both tower RRs are occupied that day. As simple as that...

On the upcoming occasion of Dussehra, how about showing the story  of lord Rama to our little ones which emphasizes the victory of Good over Evil. 

What better way than to show them RAMAYANA. Planning to show the kids an Animated version of Ramleela today.

Venue -  Banquet hall
 Time-  7pm.
Date - 4th Oct.

We would try to arrange some snacks, parents if they wish can send snacks along. 

Request parents to encourage their kids to join, it would not just be fun but they can also learn and imbibe the virtues of Lord Rama. 😍🙏🙏


Thanks to our Youngsters club for making this happen 🙏🙏🙏

05/10/22, 10:39 am - Harsh Sharma MMV H Tower: All
Given below are the building plan  variations of old and new plan. Our objections would be on these points. 

1. I Tower
Previous Plan : G+23 (46 flats)
New Plan : G+27 (52 Flats, 1 Penthouse)

2. I Tower height increase by 14.85M (48.72 ft)

3. 3 New Villas proposed in new plan (In the land between EWS & Mount Olumpus Day Care). That land is part of our 16 acres. 

4. Old Plan : Total population : 4486
New plan : Total population 4512

5. Old Approved Plan : Club House approved construction plan vs actual variance. This is being studied and will be objected to.  

6. As per OC, 16.369 acre land area.

As per new and old building plans, 15.0481 acres. Where is remaining 0.888 acre?

We will submit our letter of objections to DTCP and would request all residents to sign it. Will shortly advice the details.
Thanks

Dear MMV Family,
Attached is the draft letter to DTCP prepared by our in-house experts Mr Pankaj & Mr Chunnu.  
The draft is well curated and addresses all the main technical/legal points. However, our friends too will have their inputs, we are sure.

In order to curtail long messages/discussion, all intrested residents lets meet in club house tomorrow between 11 to 1230 where Pankaj & Chunnu will try and answer and provide clarification to your queries.

 *Now, we have 2 options* - 1/ We can review it & sign it to *submit as a community objection* from all or 2/ All of us can decide to send *objections at individual levels.* But this objection letter must go to DTCP as soon.

 Thanks for your support & patience !!
