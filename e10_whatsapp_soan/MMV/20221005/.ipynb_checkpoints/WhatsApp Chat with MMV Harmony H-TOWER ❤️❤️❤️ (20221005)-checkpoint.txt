We haven't found anything suspicious yet. Probably because we are pretty precautious always.
Also, we have never taken her anywhere with us.

03/10/22, 6:31 pm - +91 83840 67456: Just to clarify
I was not asking for myself.
I just saw someone using the Passenger lift along with their pet.
We didn't take the lift because we weren't comfortable.
03/10/22, 6:32 pm - +91 96506 49949: As per pet guidelines which are formed by FMt, pet will go by service lift only.
03/10/22, 6:33 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Housing associations cannot ban pets in elevators through notices put up for the purpose. They cannot frame bye-laws framed or amended for the purpose, even with the consent of the general body. If the pets are in leash and with the owner no one can disallow that.
03/10/22, 6:35 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: We always try to use service lifts but the frequency of the lift is a bit slow and even the dog cannot wait for so long, so sometimes people use passenger lift while going down , I shouldn‚Äôt think that should be a hurdle to anyone. Mostly pet parents use service lifts only while going up.

03/10/22, 6:40 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Manish Ji, we are following the protocols on case to case basis the things are shown in different ways, I have mentioned above that most of the time we use service lifts only.

03/10/22, 6:51 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Ananya ji , please don‚Äôt drag it unnecessarily we have already explained the reason above, sometimes on case to case basis owners tend up to use the passenger lifts, it would be better if the conversation ends over here.

03/10/22, 6:55 pm - Ashish Jain: The Handmaid's Tale is a futuristic dystopian novel[6] by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, published in 1985. It is set in a near-future New England, in a strongly patriarchal, totalitarian theonomic state, known as the Republic of Gilead, which has overthrown the United States government.[7] The central character and narrator is a woman named Offred, one of the "handmaids"‚Äîa group of women who are forcibly assigned to produce children for the "commanders"‚Äîthe ruling class of men in Gilead.

03/10/22, 6:56 pm - Ashish Jain: Has anyone read this?
03/10/22, 6:57 pm - Ashish Jain: Nineteen Eighty-Four (also stylised as 1984) is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale written by the English writer George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the totalitarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.[2][3][4] More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated.
03/10/22, 7:02 pm - +91 98370 76788: Ashishji... your story sure is pathetic! Atleast you realize it was your mistake and you were incapable of looking after your Moti. Don't blame people around you for this but look for the fault within you. If I say something I say it with proof....not for just saying. So stop blaming others for your incompetence and try and improve yourself . Its more of hygiene and cleanliness than just blaming others for your own lack of the same. Thanks a lot and hope you have learnt something from your mistakes. I'm sure wherever Moti is he must be fine and in a healthier atmosphere. God looks after each and everyone and will surely look after him too. üôè

03/10/22, 7:05 pm - Ashish Jain: Has anyone read this?
03/10/22, 7:06 pm - Ashish Jain: Lord of the Flies is a 1954 novel by the Nobel Prize-winning British author William Golding. The plot concerns a group of British boys who are stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempts to govern themselves. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality.
03/10/22, 7:19 pm - +91 99582 99816: This can't be done Ankit ji. Probably shouldn't be done unless it is utmost necessary.
We don't want to hurt anyone's sentiments, but we should also understand that guidelines are there for healthy and happening environment. Chaos won't take us anywhere.

03/10/22, 7:29 pm - Ashish Jain: "My Land and My People" tells the story of the Dalai Lama's life, as well providing a history of the shocking subjugation of the Tibetan people by the Chinese government. Rather than being an angry indictment, however, the book instead issues a gentle appeal for understanding and peace.

The housing market can be vexing: while some neighborhoods get ridiculously expensive and price out longtime residents, others have historic homes sitting vacant without demand. Equitable housing developer and TED Fellow Bree Jones shares how she found a way to revitalize neighborhoods experiencing hyper-vacancy while preventing gentrification -- supporting home buyers and transforming communities along the way.

04/10/22, 2:16 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Hi Everyone 

On the upcoming occasion of Dussehra, how about showing the story  of lord Rama to our little ones which emphasizes the victory of Good over Evil. 

What better way than to show them RAMAYANA. Planning to show the kids an Animated version of Ramleela today.

Venue -  Banquet hall
 Time-  7pm.
Date - 4th Oct.

We would try to arrange some snacks, parents if they wish can send snacks along. 

Request parents to encourage their kids to join, it would not just be fun but they can also learn and imbibe the virtues of Lord Rama. üòçüôèüôè


Thanks to our Youngsters club for making this happen üôèüôèüôè

05/10/22, 10:39 am - +91 98188 95111: All
Given below are the building plan  variations of old and new plan. Our objections would be on these points. 

1. I Tower
Previous Plan : G+23 (46 flats)
New Plan : G+27 (52 Flats, 1 Penthouse)

2. I Tower height increase by 14.85M (48.72 ft)

3. 3 New Villas proposed in new plan (In the land between EWS & Mount Olumpus Day Care). That land is part of our 16 acres. 

4. Old Plan : Total population : 4486
New plan : Total population 4512

5. Old Approved Plan : Club House approved construction plan vs actual variance. This is being studied and will be objected to.  

6. As per OC, 16.369 acre land area.

As per new and old building plans, 15.0481 acres. Where is remaining 0.888 acre?

We will submit our letter of objections to DTCP and would request all residents to sign it. Will shortly advice the details.
Thanks
