03/10/22, 2:19 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: How pathetic, unsensible  and cheap act that local  maid/caretaker is using our swimming pool after abiding Clubhouse Rules and bypassing Tower RRs and FMT rules and regulations and how these tenants allowed them to use it . It's a crystal clear matter of hygiene and breaching society rules and regulations . Not tolerable at all... literally . Tenants are from H1202 after checking this maid profile who has appointed her .

03/10/22, 7:01 am - +91 99587 88882: Although this type of action should not have been required but since such events are happening and even seen this needs to be addressed and actioned a upon without further delay.
03/10/22, 8:14 am - +91 99582 99816: Hi All, We are from H204.
We also take her service for our baby's massage.
She arrives, does her job and leaves. We sit there while she massages our baby.
We haven't found anything suspicious yet. Probably because we are pretty precautious always.
Also, we have never taken her anywhere with us.
03/10/22, 8:52 am - +91 95995 57065: Good morning all.
We are doing Kanya Pooja today between 10:30-11:00 today.
Could you pls send over your lovely daughters to ours H-2004 for 10-15 min? A line of confirmation 1:1 to me will be very helpful 🙏🏼
Look forward. Thank you so much. 🙂

03/10/22, 6:26 pm - +91 98188 95111: Pls use  service lift service
03/10/22, 6:26 pm - +91 98188 95111: Only
03/10/22, 6:31 pm - +91 83840 67456: Just to clarify
I was not asking for myself.
I just saw someone using the Passenger lift along with their pet.
We didn't take the lift because we weren't comfortable.
03/10/22, 6:32 pm - +91 96506 49949: As per pet guidelines which are formed by FMt, pet will go by service lift only.
03/10/22, 6:33 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Housing associations cannot ban pets in elevators through notices put up for the purpose. They cannot frame bye-laws framed or amended for the purpose, even with the consent of the general body. If the pets are in leash and with the owner no one can disallow that.
03/10/22, 6:35 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: We always try to use service lifts but the frequency of the lift is a bit slow and even the dog cannot wait for so long, so sometimes people use passenger lift while going down , I shouldn’t think that should be a hurdle to anyone. Mostly pet parents use service lifts only while going up.

Passenger lift and Service lift both was on Ground floor.
But thanks for update that dogs should be on priority not babies.🙏🏻
03/10/22, 6:37 pm - Ashish Jain: Dogs are families too.
03/10/22, 6:37 pm - +91 83840 67456: And yes right babies can wait but dogs can not
03/10/22, 6:39 pm - +91 96506 49949: Kalpesh, this is request you to follow the defined guidelines which are being followed by most of residents in society..if any changes need you can discuss with fmt directly..pls follow the same..🙏🙏🙏🙏 ..

03/10/22, 6:39 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Apologies mam if you felt it wrong but I am just explaining from my end. Rest is up to you, how you consider it. Even the pet parents are aware about it if a lady is with a small baby, we are more concerned.
03/10/22, 6:40 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Manish Ji, we are following the protocols on case to case basis the things are shown in different ways, I have mentioned above that most of the time we use service lifts only.
03/10/22, 6:41 pm - +91 83840 67456: I am not against any pet animals, but if there is a matter to differentiate between baby and pet animals then definitely I will choose baby first.
03/10/22, 6:44 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: For such instances please take pics for record so that we can inform accordingly to them
03/10/22, 6:44 pm - +91 98188 95111: Bhai sometimes passenger lift mein bhi time laag jata tab kya karogae so have patience fhir bhi you can ask tower guard why the lift is stuck at one floor.
03/10/22, 6:45 pm - Ashish Jain: Pretty aweful!
Dogs are being compared with babies these days. 🤣🤣🤣
03/10/22, 6:47 pm - +91 83840 67456: Yes someone(pet owner) did this not me.

We are expecting that maid should follow guidelines and what about us?
03/10/22, 6:47 pm - +91 83840 67456: And that owner was from 18th or 20th floor
03/10/22, 6:48 pm - +91 98188 95111: Apni lift ki take.care hum mein hi  karni hogi
 fmt toh bol dega hum kal clean karenge aaj ki cleaning toh hogai.
Plus some people are really afraid of any pet.
03/10/22, 6:48 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Relax everyone
03/10/22, 6:48 pm - +91 83840 67456: Right sir, some people are not comfortable with dogs
03/10/22, 6:49 pm - +91 96506 49949: Harsh, Ankit bro ,let's close this here only...residents are enough mature ...pls dnt make it lengthy now...
03/10/22, 6:51 pm - Kalpesh Sambharia H Tower MMV: Ananya ji , please don’t drag it unnecessarily we have already explained the reason above, sometimes on case to case basis owners tend up to use the passenger lifts, it would be better if the conversation ends over here.

03/10/22, 6:55 pm - Ashish Jain: The Handmaid's Tale is a futuristic dystopian novel[6] by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, published in 1985. It is set in a near-future New England, in a strongly patriarchal, totalitarian theonomic state, known as the Republic of Gilead, which has overthrown the United States government.[7] The central character and narrator is a woman named Offred, one of the "handmaids"—a group of women who are forcibly assigned to produce children for the "commanders"—the ruling class of men in Gilead.

03/10/22, 6:56 pm - Ashish Jain: Has anyone read this?
03/10/22, 6:57 pm - Ashish Jain: Nineteen Eighty-Four (also stylised as 1984) is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale written by the English writer George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the totalitarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.[2][3][4] More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated.
03/10/22, 7:02 pm - +91 98370 76788: Ashishji... your story sure is pathetic! Atleast you realize it was your mistake and you were incapable of looking after your Moti. Don't blame people around you for this but look for the fault within you. If I say something I say it with proof....not for just saying. So stop blaming others for your incompetence and try and improve yourself . Its more of hygiene and cleanliness than just blaming others for your own lack of the same. Thanks a lot and hope you have learnt something from your mistakes. I'm sure wherever Moti is he must be fine and in a healthier atmosphere. God looks after each and everyone and will surely look after him too. 🙏

03/10/22, 7:05 pm - Ashish Jain: Has anyone read this?
03/10/22, 7:06 pm - Ashish Jain: Lord of the Flies is a 1954 novel by the Nobel Prize-winning British author William Golding. The plot concerns a group of British boys who are stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempts to govern themselves. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality.
03/10/22, 7:19 pm - +91 99582 99816: This can't be done Ankit ji. Probably shouldn't be done unless it is utmost necessary.
We don't want to hurt anyone's sentiments, but we should also understand that guidelines are there for healthy and happening environment. Chaos won't take us anywhere.

Peace out 🤞🏻

03/10/22, 7:29 pm - Ashish Jain: Has anyone read this?
03/10/22, 7:29 pm - Ashish Jain: "My Land and My People" tells the story of the Dalai Lama's life, as well providing a history of the shocking subjugation of the Tibetan people by the Chinese government. Rather than being an angry indictment, however, the book instead issues a gentle appeal for understanding and peace.

The housing market can be vexing: while some neighborhoods get ridiculously expensive and price out longtime residents, others have historic homes sitting vacant without demand. Equitable housing developer and TED Fellow Bree Jones shares how she found a way to revitalize neighborhoods experiencing hyper-vacancy while preventing gentrification -- supporting home buyers and transforming communities along the way.

When we are getting party in 7th floor extended balcony
04/10/22, 12:11 am - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Some people won't come to Clubhouse,  neither tower reception area so being generous if someone come to take your sign on a request letter for forming RWA membership request you are taking it otherwise .  I have gone to tower C also because some handicapped person is there and won't able to come and sign it . Don't you won't elections would be conducted in society . I have just came because both tower RRs are occupied that day. As simple as that...
04/10/22, 12:12 am - Ashish Jain: Am having a very bad day. Please ignore.
04/10/22, 12:12 am - +91 98217 35903: Mr Jain….i have been reading your sarcastic messages in the group since quite long time and sorry to say there is certain decorum we expect from each house owner/tenant and you are going way beyond that….its my humble request to you either you behave in normal manner or leave the group…otherwise will have to forcibly delete you from the group which I don’t want….if you have any concerns you can contact me anytime, will be happy to answer your queries….rest assured we are all family but its give and take

04/10/22, 2:16 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Hi Everyone 

On the upcoming occasion of Dussehra, how about showing the story  of lord Rama to our little ones which emphasizes the victory of Good over Evil. 

What better way than to show them RAMAYANA. Planning to show the kids an Animated version of Ramleela today.

Venue -  Banquet hall
 Time-  7pm.
Date - 4th Oct.

We would try to arrange some snacks, parents if they wish can send snacks along. 

Request parents to encourage their kids to join, it would not just be fun but they can also learn and imbibe the virtues of Lord Rama. 😍🙏🙏


Thanks to our Youngsters club for making this happen 🙏🙏🙏

05/10/22, 10:39 am - +91 98188 95111: Important Mesaage regarding I tower and the letters received from mapsko regarding the same.
05/10/22, 10:39 am - +91 98188 95111: All
Given below are the building plan  variations of old and new plan. Our objections would be on these points. 

1. I Tower
Previous Plan : G+23 (46 flats)
New Plan : G+27 (52 Flats, 1 Penthouse)

2. I Tower height increase by 14.85M (48.72 ft)

3. 3 New Villas proposed in new plan (In the land between EWS & Mount Olumpus Day Care). That land is part of our 16 acres. 

4. Old Plan : Total population : 4486
New plan : Total population 4512

5. Old Approved Plan : Club House approved construction plan vs actual variance. This is being studied and will be objected to.  

6. As per OC, 16.369 acre land area.

As per new and old building plans, 15.0481 acres. Where is remaining 0.888 acre?

We will submit our letter of objections to DTCP and would request all residents to sign it. Will shortly advice the details.
Thanks
