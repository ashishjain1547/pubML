16/12/22, 4:25 am - +91 98104 53249: But I am also conflicted about it. This is UB2. If someone parked in wrong parking‚Ä¶ there could be 2 reasons:

1) they are guests who saw an empty parking and parked it. 

2) they are residents, who had an extra car‚Ä¶ and parked it in an empty parking. 

I mean these are two possibilities right.
16/12/22, 4:25 am - +91 98104 53249: <Media omitted>
16/12/22, 4:25 am - +91 98104 53249: But if we‚Äôre clamping the wheels‚Ä¶ what if the said person gets into an emergency where they need to go to hospital or airport‚Ä¶ do we have the management system sorted who can immediately come and unclamp the car to address the immediate concern or the person is at stake of losing something much more just because they parked wrong??
16/12/22, 4:25 am - +91 98104 53249: Not trying to stirr an argument or fight‚Ä¶ something came to mind so wrote it here to ponder‚Ä¶ #AllisWell

16/12/22, 5:54 am - Saurabh Dawar MMV: That's a very good point Sanjeev. I think everybody's happy right now thinking that it won't happen to them but it can happen to anyone. And considering the awesome FMT and systems we have in place I am sure it will happen to anyone and everyone.
16/12/22, 5:58 am - +91 98104 53249: Yeah‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt want it. Yaha guard Conceirge pe so jaata hai (no offense we understand raat ke 3 baj rahe hai)‚Ä¶ emergency to kisi but waqt aa sakti hai.
16/12/22, 6:00 am - +91 98104 53249: Simple question is-

Am I supposed to bear a life expense or something similar to it, just because I parked my car wrong?

That‚Äôs it.
16/12/22, 6:01 am - +91 98104 53249: If you are sure that your FMT and Management and Security is so spot on that they can respond immediately, then it‚Äôs fine. 

But else‚Ä¶
16/12/22, 6:06 am - Saurabh Dawar MMV: Also the sales pitch was that we have ample space for visitors parking. Suddenly it has become we have significant low number of visitors parking. All the penalties are levied on residents. What about the penalties on laps by FMT? Also I don't think it is fair to get visitors pay for parking if they are staying for more than 2 days. And who has agreed to such rediculous rules. Were our RWA/ RR connsulted for this? I mean if my sister is coming to stay with me for a week. I need to pay extra charges for parking?
16/12/22, 6:09 am - +91 98104 53249: I think the current RWA or Counselors have some wrong idea. Because few things which should be ‚ÄúObvious‚Äù and ‚Äúallowed‚Äù are new or not allowed MMV. I mean I‚Äôve never been to a society where guest have to pay for parking. Not even in DLF.
16/12/22, 6:09 am - Saurabh Dawar MMV: Very true
16/12/22, 6:11 am - +91 98104 53249: I think and pardon my language but it seems like the RWA or whatever the association is doing nothing but just stating laws either by builder or Govt.
16/12/22, 6:11 am - +91 98104 53249: There is no actual fight for what‚Äôs right.
16/12/22, 6:15 am - Saurabh Dawar MMV: I am not sure if it was discussed with RWA/RR either. Why would they agree to such rediculous practices. being residents themselves
16/12/22, 6:16 am - +91 98104 53249: Exactly. My question.

16/12/22, 6:18 am - +91 98104 53249: I know it‚Äôs not ideal and it‚Äôs frustrating when someone parks in your spot but are you prepared how to deal with it? Your security system and your FMT? You LOCK someone‚Äôs car and what if there is an emergency?
16/12/22, 6:23 am - Saurabh Dawar MMV: In case of emergency instead of walking the resident will run to FMT office ( due to no signal in basement) LB people will have to run at double the speed. Pay fine at lightning speed. Cash only because again Paytm won't work without signal. Drag the FMT manager to find person who can unclamp the wheel. Pick up that person on the shoulder and rush back to the car to unclamp the car and vice versa.
16/12/22, 6:24 am - Saurabh Dawar MMV: I guess this was the strategy behind the rule
16/12/22, 6:26 am - +91 98104 53249: There couldn‚Äôt have been a better breakdown here‚Ä¶ honestly.
16/12/22, 6:27 am - +91 98104 53249: What is wrong with your guys (RWA)?
16/12/22, 6:30 am - Saurabh Dawar MMV: Suddenly there's a feeling of  living in a concentration camp while paying maintenance for resort.
16/12/22, 6:31 am - +91 98104 53249: Haha true actually. Should we also wear uniforms?

16/12/22, 6:37 am - +91 98104 53249: I am 200% supporter of it. Clamping is ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs stupid. It makes you feel like your still I office or something.

16/12/22, 6:49 am - +91 99998 21063: Clamping is not a solution.  In case of emergency it's difficult to manage.  

 No network in basement and difficult to arrange the cab in sec 79
16/12/22, 6:50 am - +91 99998 21063: Before to implement anything we need to call the meeting of residence may we get the better idea of any concern we facing in society
16/12/22, 6:53 am - +91 98989 11598: Hi Sanjeev, sorry to dampen the spirits but the FMT hasn't clamped this car üòÖ  I wish our FMT were that diligent and fast in taking actions.

*This is our car and we have clamped it for extra security* ü§£. Our car keys were misplaced by Shankar (car cleaner) and he miraculously gave us the car keys back after two days. Hence we started clamping our car for security reasons.
16/12/22, 7:07 am - +91 98104 53249: Yes Rachita, just spoke with Mayank but I guess everything remains the same.

16/12/22, 7:15 am - +91 98100 26190: Very wise and appropriate action üëçüèª
16/12/22, 7:15 am - +91 88027 71414: That is completely logical and makes sense. Given there could be a medical emergency to attend, atleast after clamping within let's say 10-15mins, resident should be informed that the car is not parked properly and therefore is clamped.
16/12/22, 7:16 am - +91 82917 66046: Good morning everyone. 

While my initial thought was to not respond to any of the queries on this platform especially ones that are laced with sarcasm/personal attacks, the point about medical emergencies is quite pressing and valid.

The way to avoid any unfortunate incident is that the guard informs the car owner within 10 minutes from clamping that the car has been clamped. I'm sure once informed people would be quite eager to get the clamps removed for the sake of their own mobility.

People here in the last many months have made requests, complained, fought over cars parked randomly. I'm sure we all know by now none of these have worked thus far. There are people who still haven't collected parking stickers despite several reminders being sent on MyGate. 

Overnight guest parking in most societies is not allowed. Especially when there are only 32 visitor parkings for 750 flats. 

Should additional nights be charged? It is charged in some societies and is not charged in others. Tata does it in their properties. DLF might not.
16/12/22, 7:17 am - +91 82917 66046: *Read that as overnight parking for more than one night.
16/12/22, 7:22 am - +91 98975 20593: 32 parkings for 756 flats but this is not what was told us during sales it is happening coz builder is selling the extra parkings to make money
16/12/22, 7:23 am - Saurabh Dawar MMV: Arnimaal ji with due respect you are finding  sarcasm because these decisions should be taken unanimously and not published on my gate  randomly. We all understand that different societies have different rules but why do we have to empose  toughest of the rules in our society only. The warning should be given before clamping. The person might would have parked on someone else parking bu mistake also since a lot times buildings garbage is lying in their parking. Why are we mixing innocent mistakers and guests with repeated offenders
16/12/22, 7:23 am - +91 99998 21063: How many total parking in our society may be around 1450 nos . We have 750 nos flat 

You have details of how many additional car parking purchased by residence. 

If car parking available in basement why we're not adding guest parking in basement
16/12/22, 7:24 am - +91 82917 66046: Coming to the point of committee doing useless things instead of things they should be doing. This committee has 3 tasks ahead of it:

1. RWA memberships and forms. For this work has already been initiated. Since the date of notification, we have received 2 forms from individuals and all forms from RRs are still being handed over. We cannot do anything to speeden this process, except sending reminders.

2. Day to day management of maintenance: For this we are 100% dependent on vendors. And there are many. Meeting with each of them, understanding what their processes are and what needs to improve is not an overnight job. It takes time. And we are on it. Besides there are details which need to come from the builder on finances. Were we assuming he will hand them over in a day? 
 
3. Policy framework: There are currently NO policies in place. Can any society function without policies? This is one area where intervention from FMT or builder is minimum. And that's why you're getting a feeling this is all the committee is working on. 

I always respond to queries and questions, despite us wanting to not do it on WhatsApp because I understand it's not possible for everyone to come to the clubhouse, but let's be civil to each other. We are all residents here. Today there is an AC, tomorrow there will be an RWA. Nothing will change.

16/12/22, 7:28 am - +91 82917 66046: If we start framing policies after discussing unanimously, we will never be able to get a single policy framed sir. 
The policy has been published, feedback and suggestions are being invited. 
Policy koi paththar ki lakeer nahi hai. It is a work in progress.
Raise objections. 
Discuss. 
We have always been open to that. 
But you have to trust the judgement of people in the committee. If you don't, we should resign.

16/12/22, 7:30 am - +91 82917 66046: Guest parking basement mein kaise karoge. Will you go down to receive your guest every time they come? There are access cards being implemented there. 
Logistically it's not feasible. 
I know some people mentioned that builder had promised it while selling flats. But has he given it in writing to any of us? Toh kis cheez pe challenge kare usko? Please tell me.
16/12/22, 7:31 am - +91 82917 66046: Malik Ji had sent a message 2 days back. He's clearly mentioned it.
16/12/22, 7:33 am - +91 99998 21063: Basement me he to jana h guest ko lene not an issue it's not to travel in KM

AC team need to work on such issue also . Please don't be answer like builder . AC working for residence so need to take up all concerns.
16/12/22, 7:35 am - +91 99998 21063: You have details of how many parking left . When you will work on such issue then we able to get the solution
16/12/22, 7:36 am - Saurabh Dawar MMV: Not sure if 2 days and single message is good enough window to submit suggestions.
16/12/22, 7:38 am - +91 99998 21063: Just suggestion 
They need to call the Residence meeting once month.
16/12/22, 7:38 am - +91 82917 66046: Yeh sahi hai. Builder ko lagta hai aap residents ki taraf ho. Residents ko lagta hai aap builder ki taraf ho. 
Builder kisi ka bhai lagta hai kya hum mein se? Ya woh paise de raha hai humko? 

There are 1200 finished parkings left after allocations. Unless builder has given it in writing that visitor parking will be in the basement, we have no legal right to tell him to make these available for visitor's parking. We can suggest and he can reject.
16/12/22, 7:43 am - +91 82917 66046: You know the people in the AC. Tell me one of them who has ever sided with the builder on anything thats illegal?

Eshwaran Ji
Gulshan Ji
Vedic Prakash Ji
Tanuj Ji
Rajneesh
Hemant
Me

Please tell us who of the above has ever spoken language of the builder? 

Let's not make statements which we personally are also not convinced of.
16/12/22, 7:47 am - +91 99998 21063: AC doing well üôè

I hope very soon we will able make RWA..
16/12/22, 7:48 am - +91 98737 20770: We joined this group yesterday only, we have not seen any notification in individual tower group.
16/12/22, 7:48 am - +91 99998 21063: In this message for basement paking word mentioned which used by builder
16/12/22, 7:48 am - +91 82917 66046: There is a message on MyGate, Telegram and WhatsApp. In both Hindi and English üôèüèª
16/12/22, 7:52 am - +91 99998 21063: Please read you're message related to basement parking word mentioned which used in every meeting by builder 

There's so many thing which is important for society need to take up for the Handover of society. AC may be working on that , can be communicate by Gerneral residence meeting
16/12/22, 7:54 am - +91 72763 03938: Sorry to say @918291766046  but these strict rules are not for residents. Don't know who has created it but these rules are ridiculous. We are living in a society not in prison( ki aap yha park ni kr skte vha nahi kr skte). Everyone has a different understanding at the time of purchasing a flat. But right now by drafting such rules which is against residents (previously club house timings to 10 PM, access cards and now this. In the future may be pet policy) you guys are making residents life miserable.
16/12/22, 7:54 am - +91 98737 20770: Whatever policies should be made, they should be made for the comfort of the residents, two clauses should be removed  from existing policy
1) clamping the car, it's seems we have committed some offense and who will be responsible if something happen wrong with someone
just because just unwanted clamping.
2) Why we need to pay extra parking cost, are we in mall or in market, are we not paying maintenance charge, agree for longer tenure guests there should be approval process but paying extra parking cost is definitely not in favour of residents.
This needs to be discussed, no body can enforce such rules forcefully..
16/12/22, 7:58 am - +91 88613 26996: Unanimous decision can never be there with 750 residents but opinions of residents can be taken and considered while making a policy. When major are policies being implemented at least a draft version should be discussed calling a residents meeting. It‚Äôs no use calling everyone individually to meet  and provide suggestions after implementing a policy.!
16/12/22, 7:59 am - +91 72763 03938: Agree!! A residents meeting should be called before implementing these strict rules.
16/12/22, 7:59 am - +91 98737 20770: Agree!!
16/12/22, 8:03 am - +91 98975 20593: Just one point there should be fines on vendors aswell if they are not doing there assigned work for eg. Just check terrace there is literally algae n it is full of dirt, plants are dying due to overwatering night shift guards sleeping
16/12/22, 8:05 am - +91 98765 55139: Totally agree
16/12/22, 8:06 am - +91 95826 88830: Agree, this is the standard process to implement any new policy in any society, which should be followed
16/12/22, 8:10 am - +91 98737 20770: It‚Äôs looks like a ‚Äúmazak‚Äù, that we need to pay extra parking charge for our guests.

16/12/22, 8:18 am - +91 88825 74968: I still remember couple of weeks back people were back of clamping cars parked for many days on ground floor. Many of us aggressively complaint that someone parked car in thr parking lot. Now when clamps were arrived many of us liked and praised committee for efforts. Now when suddenly charges of visitor parking came in picture this all started. In many of the societies it is not even allowed to enter with car. One needs to park car outside the premise leave the overnight parking thing. Here main concern should only be how to handle clamping process? So that residents/ visitors should not suffer in emergency situations.
16/12/22, 8:26 am - +91 82917 66046: I feel everyone here needs to think of the future and the larger picture. When a people initially started living here, there were 100-200-300 flats occupied. From last year to now, the situation has changed drastically. The numbers are totally different.
The challenge in the future is going to be managing the limited infrastructure and resources. Whether it's the clubhouse or parkings or our common areas. 

Yes, it will appear to be stifling and ridiculous for a lot of those who have been living here since quite some time, but if we want to have a society that is managed efficiently and with least conflict, we will need these kind of strict policies.

And I'm saying this from my own experience of having lived in dense societies with 3000-5000 flats. 

These rules ONLY help to reduce conflict and mishaps.
16/12/22, 8:32 am - +91 82917 66046: *Read that as 3000-5000 residents. Not flats ü§£
16/12/22, 8:34 am - +91 99998 21063: As per approved layout of society no parking shown on ground floor .

If we will see the layout of basement all parking marked in layout
16/12/22, 8:38 am - +91 72763 03938: We agree @918291766046 but only concern is to discuss this with residents first before finalizing it not the other way. We all are educated and can understand but this is not the right way. If this will be agreed first between residents  then any rule or decision can be applied but without that chaos will happen.
16/12/22, 8:40 am - +91 99997 57040: Totally agree as others say. Plz discuss with residents first before taking any decision.
16/12/22, 8:41 am - +91 99998 21063: We can utilize the remaining parking for Guest till no one purchase 

As per approved layout no parking slot mention on ground floor .
16/12/22, 8:42 am - +91 72763 03938: I still don't understand why you guys are not calling a residents meeting. We all are the ones who opted for Administrator and creating committee. But now it looks like the committee is doing whatever they want without mutual understanding.

16/12/22, 8:50 am - +91 95826 88830: Totally agree, policies should be inplace to run the society efficiently

My concern is about the way this car parking policy has been implemented.

A general body meeting should be held with residents with draft version of policy and if majority of people agree with it, they should sign it and then policy should be applied.

If this process will not be followed by AC or coming RWA, their good intentions will always be questionable.
16/12/22, 8:52 am - +91 72763 03938: Right even RWA can't make a policy without discussing with residents.
16/12/22, 8:56 am - +91 97175 55048: Hi good morning.  What is the policy if 3 to 4 cars of guests to be parked for 4 to t hours?
16/12/22, 8:56 am - +91 70301 19007: Makes sense!! üëç
16/12/22, 9:06 am - +91 99998 21063: Request to all admin avoid to send the link for joining in group

16/12/22, 9:17 am - +91 98103 02049: Dear All, good morning
16/12/22, 9:18 am - +91 98103 02049: Just saw a series of messages, discussion on parking policy...
16/12/22, 9:19 am - +91 98103 02049: First of all...do we all agree that society must have some rules and regulations or it should be left to each one's wisdom and preferences?
16/12/22, 9:20 am - +91 98103 02049: Please remember.....if we chose to keep it open...there would always be conflicting choices by people on various issues...
16/12/22, 9:21 am - +91 70301 19007: Please go through the messages carefully. Residents are not denying for rules and regulations. They are against the way policy are being imposed on them.
16/12/22, 9:21 am - +91 99867 14748: Yes sir societies should have rules and regulations, but implemented after discussion with residents, not forced on them. Additionally I see an attempt to commercialize basic necessities here. That is worrisome
16/12/22, 9:22 am - +91 98103 02049: Having said that, Arni ji has said and I reiterate...that we all are trying to make a beginning here....nothing gets cast in stone....
16/12/22, 9:23 am - +91 98103 02049: Rest assured none of the AO, AC has any intent of pinching anyone...not to forget that we all are also residents and will have to comply to these and future rules made by any governing body
16/12/22, 9:24 am - +91 72763 03938: Tanuj ji committee is formed to get RWA in place not for policies. Any update on that??
16/12/22, 9:26 am - +91 70301 19007: Personally the idea of clamps seems good in public area. But with in society does it really makes sense? Many people on WhatsApp were in favour of it I know but now many are against also. Don't admin team think to take opinion of residents before adding this clause in policy?
16/12/22, 9:26 am - +91 72763 03938: By publishing on my gate you are forcing these policies. As a resident you should discuss draft policy with residents first.
16/12/22, 9:26 am - +91 98103 02049: Puneet ji, we can surely talk about it on one 
on one to explain. All I can say with my experience is that it's not just so simple.....though it may look like...e.g. as soon as AO is appointed by Govt...he is supposed to take charge of running the society first and organize it...while working on RWA formation
16/12/22, 9:26 am - +91 70228 88847: This is true and correct.
16/12/22, 9:27 am - +91 72763 03938: Your first priority should be RWA as after RWA these policies can be implemented otherwise these policies can be null and void if next RWA members don't want this
16/12/22, 9:28 am - +91 70228 88847: People really don't have to worry if they don't park at the wrong place. It is just that if you park at your designated area you won't be clamped. Plain and simply. So just park in the correct designated area
16/12/22, 9:32 am - +91 98103 02049: I would edit ..not null and void...but can surely amend and edit...that's fine... but...then again someone else may rise to say that he/she does not like it and tag RWA as defunct....I do not think that is a gud practice to put...dangerous for any society....mind it...we have done it already twice....RWA-RR-AO....best is, let the policy be rolled out and if anything is to be revisited....let's do it....
16/12/22, 9:32 am - +91 82917 66046: If the next RWA doesn't want it they can nullify it by all means. But as of today and as per the law, Mr Malik has been charged with 3 things:
1. Day to day running of society affairs which includes putting policies and systems in place. 
2. Maintenance handover from builder.
3. Formation of an RWA
It is what is written in his appointment letter.
16/12/22, 9:33 am - +91 72763 03938: What if anyone has 2-3 two wheeler and at the time of purchasing flat they were told that they  can park it anywhere in a dead spot. Now due to this ridiculous policy people feel cheated. Only concern is why to make such policy without taking consent from residents.
16/12/22, 9:33 am - +91 98103 02049: üëç
16/12/22, 9:34 am - +91 70228 88847: People really need to understand for point 3 to be effective point 2 and 1 is very important and needs to be sorted out asap
16/12/22, 9:34 am - +91 82917 66046: Didn't we know what the role of an administrator is when we called for one?
16/12/22, 9:34 am - +91 72763 03938: But your didn't give a chance to edit Tanuj ji.
16/12/22, 9:36 am - +91 72763 03938: I am in favor of making rules in society but not in this way..
16/12/22, 9:36 am - +91 98103 02049: Puneet ji...for once let's agree that builder person said that....do you as educated and responsible resident feel this to be a good practice.... imagine for once 200 residents having 2 bikes each and parking all over...I humbly say....we need to make a balance please
16/12/22, 9:36 am - +91 70228 88847: Clamping is for four wheelers in my understanding, for 2 wheelers also framework would have to be there as if every house had 2 - 3 wheelers then we have problem in our hand.
16/12/22, 9:37 am - +91 70228 88847: To be give you rough no anything between 1500 to 2300 vehicles.
16/12/22, 9:38 am - +91 72763 03938: So what do you suggest they should sell their vehicles as they can't park it üòÇüòÇ
16/12/22, 9:38 am - +91 98103 02049: Again I say, it's a start.....largely ok...if there are 1/2/3 items let's talk about it my friend......
16/12/22, 9:38 am - +91 72763 03938: Society h bhai ye .koi dharmashala nahi h ki parking full now you have to pay üòÇüòÇ
16/12/22, 9:39 am - +91 88613 26512: Car clamping should be there‚Ä¶ it is there in all societies‚Ä¶ otherwise, people will never follow the rule to park at designated area‚Ä¶ this has been requested by all in past and there was a strong push from residents itself to implement it at earliest‚Ä¶ I think we as residents are opposing anything and everything‚Ä¶ but yes, FMT need to ensure 100% effectiveness in removing the clamp on time and communicating the same so that no resident suffer due to this‚Ä¶ 

Second, for the payment of visitor parking.. I think that clause needs to be revised‚Ä¶ if a guest is coming for longer duration, residents need to take pre-approval and communicate‚Ä¶ there should not be any charges to pay for your guest coming for 4 days to your house‚Ä¶ if a resident is requesting on repeated basis let‚Äôs say more than twice in quarter, then they have to pay‚Ä¶
16/12/22, 9:39 am - +91 72763 03938: Why don't you call residents meeting for such discussion.
16/12/22, 9:39 am - +91 98737 20770: I believe, still it‚Äôs not too late, this policy can still be discussed, can we call a residents meeting on Sunday and discuss it.
16/12/22, 9:39 am - +91 70228 88847: Nahi Dada, plan karke purchase karlo.üòá
16/12/22, 9:39 am - +91 72763 03938: Jo flat buy krne se pehle hi h unko daan kr dete h üòÇ
16/12/22, 9:39 am - +91 70228 88847: Well.said rupali
16/12/22, 9:40 am - +91 82917 66046: I feel cheated when the AC in their discussions discusses that no structures should be allowed in extended balconies. 

The sales team had told me I can put a Gazebo or a . But guess what....I cannot. 
Now what do i do? 

Bend the rules because I feel cheated? 

Or gather a group of other residents who have extended balconies and call for a meeting to discuss this where it will get passed because only affected parties will attend this meeting and not majority residents?
16/12/22, 9:40 am - +91 70228 88847: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
16/12/22, 9:41 am - +91 82917 66046: Please guys. We need to be reasonable here. And 100% objective.
16/12/22, 9:41 am - +91 88613 26996: Role of administrator is to smooth functioning of society and that can never be achieved without taking the residents opinion into cognisance. Even if the PM wants to implement a policy it needs to be discussed and debated in Parliament and cannot directly implement it.!
16/12/22, 9:41 am - +91 98103 02049: Puneet, I thing, instead of discussing the whole policy and reach no where in a large gathering...I suggest let's pick one or two items that we feel needs discussion and discuss in small/large groups...no issues at all dear
16/12/22, 9:42 am - +91 82917 66046: Fair point
16/12/22, 9:42 am - +91 72763 03938: Let's do it then.. everyone will agree if you don't force anything on them
16/12/22, 9:42 am - +91 70228 88847: Anyway Saab whatsapp warrior ho jate hai, but meeting bulao toh koi nahi Ata.
16/12/22, 9:42 am - +91 98737 20770: Sounds good Sir
16/12/22, 9:42 am - +91 88613 26996: That‚Äôs also a sensible approach Tanuj Ji. Rather than than issuing directly üëçüèº

16/12/22, 9:44 am - +91 98370 76788: Well put forward...practical approach.
16/12/22, 9:45 am - +91 70301 19007: Point is not ki kon ata hai ya nahi. Be generous ki we called for general meeting and who ever were present we made a decision. That's it. This way no one will fell missed out and will follow the rules. Like RR, admin were formed with group meetings.
16/12/22, 9:45 am - +91 72763 03938: Puchna hi kyo jab basement me itne dead spot h üòÇüòÇ

16/12/22, 9:46 am - +91 98103 02049: Soumya ji, just a correction here...I said...let the policy be rolled out so that it gets into system....any concerns, let's take up aside and resolve them....should not restrict the work...we need to roll out other things and if we adopt any other approach...not much progress is feasible
16/12/22, 9:47 am - +91 72763 03938: Sorry but before policy to be roll out we need to correct some points in it .
16/12/22, 9:48 am - +91 72763 03938: Humko to bike lgana h bs.. meerut aap jao üòÇ
16/12/22, 9:48 am - +91 70228 88847: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
16/12/22, 9:51 am - +91 98765 55139: Sorry Tanuj ji, I disagree with your point, I think policies should be first discussed with residents, take agreement of the majority and then implement it. I can't understand why such a basic process cannot be followed and we are just getting in arguments.
16/12/22, 9:51 am - +91 72763 03938: Without making corrections don't think people will follow this.
16/12/22, 9:52 am - +91 88613 26512: From my past experience what I have learnt is connect with residents is must‚Ä¶ I know you are spending lot of time for the betterment of society but that will never be recognised/understood by residents if the connect is missing‚Ä¶ This is just a learning from my past experience‚Ä¶ if we discuss with residents before implementing then I am sure, they will understand the rules, give suggestions and then final version itself can be published‚Ä¶ instead of revising it later‚Ä¶
16/12/22, 9:53 am - +91 72763 03938: Agree. And that's what we are asking.
16/12/22, 9:53 am - +91 99109 30037: Why to implement a policy which has to be edited again n again 
Devote time and implement such things which majority approves 
It will safe time and energy of everyone
16/12/22, 9:53 am - +91 88613 26996: Sir - Agree to your point that rules need to be implemented but if residents are not taken in cognisance their grievances will pile up. Rules are broken when people feel it lacks the empathy for them!
16/12/22, 9:54 am - +91 98182 50395: The policy is framed after long discussion, various input from other high tech societies policy,
Moreover it can be rectified,
select your 5 person for further discussion and some changes if required,
 Please do not react ,it is our society and we are trying to do better ,
 Let's come together ,
16/12/22, 9:54 am - +91 70228 88847: Just read the policy group mai likh do konsa point pe challenge hai aur kyu?

16/12/22, 9:55 am - +91 98112 62620: Clamping is a standard practice against wrong parking in most societies  ‚Ä¶
Idea is Not to Punish but to remind that the person of parking the car correctly 
Shud be seen in the right spirit and work towards betterment of society
16/12/22, 9:55 am - +91 72763 03938: We all are equal and we all should discuss this in common platform
16/12/22, 9:56 am - +91 88613 26996: Why 5 person. Why not all the interested residents.!! Nobody is going to start wrestling match there. All are educated people. Inputs from other societies makes no sense if inputs of the own residents are not considered

16/12/22, 10:02 am - +91 88027 71414: Considering medical emergencies - after clamping within 10-15mins guard should let the resident know in person about it.

16/12/22, 10:04 am - +91 88613 26512: Yes‚Ä¶ they should call resident immediately after putting clamp‚Ä¶ they anyways check the car number and owner details from mygate, so can make a call right away as he finishes putting clamp‚Ä¶ that communication is the key‚Ä¶ if that happens, clamping is must..
16/12/22, 10:05 am - +91 82917 66046: Yes. That's how it happens in most societies. Guard calls immediately and notifies.
16/12/22, 10:05 am - +91 99994 80107: Clamping is very common practice in high rise condominiums ! Just that timely communication is strictly followed
16/12/22, 10:07 am - +91 88027 71414: Pls add this explicitly in revised version when is published
16/12/22, 10:07 am - +91 99998 21063: Before AC , we did the residence meeting many time , I don't know why we're not in favor to plan residence meeting. 

Except policy at least residence also aware what progress Is going on for taking Handover.
16/12/22, 10:08 am - +91 98730 55150: Mamta C202 Owner (8447399283) - Please add
16/12/22, 10:08 am - +91 72763 03938: Guy's seriously!! What if any medical emergency happen and when you go down your car is clamped. Clamping of cars is never a good idea in any society.
16/12/22, 10:09 am - +91 99906 16200: Clamping won't happen in the first place if people have parked correctly in their designated parking spots and are not causing any inconvenience.
16/12/22, 10:10 am - +91 99998 21063: Clamping only in case if someone park the vehicle in society road
16/12/22, 10:10 am - +91 72763 03938: Who all are supporting it is not thinking of the worst case. And if any of this happened it will be on them.

16/12/22, 10:12 am - +91 72763 03938: Bhai puri policy is revised honi chahiye üòÇ
16/12/22, 10:13 am - +91 88613 26996: We can resolve that by giving the keys of clamp to the tower security guard in front of which it‚Äôs parked! Security is always there and can open it immediately considering the emergency.!
16/12/22, 10:14 am - +91 70228 88847: I don't agree
16/12/22, 10:14 am - +91 70228 88847: Policy is more or less accurate, only rule breakers will have serious problem.

16/12/22, 10:16 am - +91 70228 88847: I have suggestion for two wheelers can use the landing area near the towers, sam place can be designated for cycles also
16/12/22, 10:17 am - +91 72763 03938: That's what is used now.

16/12/22, 10:19 am - +91 82917 66046: So to summarise areas of major concerns:

1. 2 wheeler parking needs work.

2. Extra charges for guests need to be revisited.

3. Proper communication mechanism for notification of clamping.
16/12/22, 10:20 am - +91 99998 21063: If possible can we decide the location for Cycle parking of kids.
16/12/22, 10:20 am - +91 70228 88847: Dedicated number for clamp removal
16/12/22, 10:20 am - +91 99710 22503: Yups,true
16/12/22, 10:20 am - +91 82917 66046: Yes. This is jmportant and needs to be on the surface
16/12/22, 10:20 am - +91 72763 03938: Add fine also..why residents should pay it
16/12/22, 10:20 am - +91 82917 66046: Fines are deterrent and also a source of income for RWA once formed.
16/12/22, 10:21 am - +91 70228 88847: Without fine no deterence
16/12/22, 10:21 am - +91 72763 03938: Let RWA to be formed first.
16/12/22, 10:21 am - +91 99998 21063: Just suggestion Clamping only can be in case if anyone  parked car on Society road
16/12/22, 10:21 am - +91 72763 03938: Otherwise FMT hi use kregi us fine ko
16/12/22, 10:21 am - +91 98737 20770: I disagree‚Ä¶.. our concern is to discuss this with residents first before implementing it not the other way around
16/12/22, 10:22 am - +91 82917 66046: FMT cannot make any expense without approval of administrator. As per law.
16/12/22, 10:22 am - +91 72763 03938: As you don't have any control on Society account.
16/12/22, 10:22 am - +91 72763 03938: Ha but abhi ni ho rha na vo
16/12/22, 10:22 am - +91 99906 16200: What if a car is parked in someone else's parking spot?
16/12/22, 10:23 am - +91 72763 03938: Clamped üòÇ
16/12/22, 10:23 am - +91 82917 66046: We are in the process of taking control. It's a matter of a few days. It's not like we are going to start collecting fines tomorrow. This policy will also take time to settle in. 
But now its there and in front of everyone.
16/12/22, 10:23 am - +91 99998 21063: How to do clamp it's very important if anyone not saw the clamp.  Car can be get damaged if he started the car .
16/12/22, 10:23 am - +91 72763 03938: Ha lets put that point once that is done.
16/12/22, 10:24 am - +91 72763 03938: Don't be in a hurry to make such rules.
16/12/22, 10:24 am - +91 99117 15876: If someone else parked their car at my parking spot, I will get their car clamped. Where would I park my car in that case? Probably car towing can be a better option.
16/12/22, 10:24 am - +91 99906 16200: Before clamping, the car owner needs to be contacted and asked to remove the car, if no one bothers to come then the car should be clamped.
16/12/22, 10:25 am - +91 98033 30793: A flyer on the windshield (similar to the ones being used for visitor parking) can be used
16/12/22, 10:25 am - +91 98115 23154: This message was deleted
16/12/22, 10:25 am - +91 98115 23154: Felicitations on Vijay Diwas. üëç
16/12/22, 10:25 am - +91 72763 03938: And even after clamped that car is not removed for that space then you need to park in someone else spot. Now your car will also be clamped üòÇ
16/12/22, 10:26 am - +91 99998 21063: So many suggestions come from residence. 

So why we're asking for residence meeting . They need to adress if all concern
16/12/22, 10:27 am - +91 70301 19007: Just a suggestion, regarding the Fine concept. It is very much OK these fines should be there. But once we have the control of finance with us otherwise the money will be going to black hole.
16/12/22, 10:27 am - +91 95400 96333: I have a company owned car ‚Ä¶ what is the rule position in the society regarding same ‚Ä¶ people will also be having govt owned cars ‚Ä¶. If there are vacant slots why can‚Äôt parking be allowed ‚Ä¶ we can be issued yellow coloured stickers or an area outside the society be marked say on the main road infront of society with our guards providing security cover
16/12/22, 10:28 am - +91 98975 20593: We have seen in past how effective our FMT and Security is in identifying cars parked in others spot if SECURITY N FMT is unable to identify the car then fine should be in place for them aswell
16/12/22, 10:28 am - +91 82917 66046: I am making a note of all suggestions being made here. Keep them coming please in case you're unable to meet us in the evening. 
Only request is to keep it civil and serious üôè
16/12/22, 10:29 am - +91 99994 80107: I am amazed to know that advisory committee is seeking control of account! Guys project is still incomplete there are lot of improvement areas from builder side ! Telling u from experience don't take account control from builder unless the project is completed its a trap !
16/12/22, 10:29 am - +91 72763 03938: @918291766046 more will come if you Just call for a meeting.
16/12/22, 10:29 am - +91 82917 66046: Only maintenance. Not project.
16/12/22, 10:29 am - +91 99994 80107: Ask people from other projects who did this
16/12/22, 10:29 am - +91 82917 66046: I have attended meetings in the past. Sir sabko pata hai meeting mein koi nahi aata. Yahaa zyada log active hai.
16/12/22, 10:30 am - +91 95400 96333: The solution is simple the parking stickers should have the car No as well as the parking slot number and that will help in identifying the wrongly parked car
16/12/22, 10:30 am - +91 82917 66046: Wohi gine chune 20 log aate hai.
16/12/22, 10:30 am - +91 72763 03938: Jo aate h unko to point lo aap..just by saying ki koi nahi aata is not a right way
16/12/22, 10:30 am - +91 82917 66046: Sir aap aa jaao na shaam ko üôÇ
16/12/22, 10:30 am - +91 72763 03938: Nahi..aap peet doge merko üòÇ
16/12/22, 10:30 am - +91 82917 66046: Club mein nahi aana toh terrace pe aa jaao. Mausam bhi badhiya hai ab toh
16/12/22, 10:31 am - +91 82917 66046: ü§£
16/12/22, 10:31 am - +91 98975 20593: There have been instances in past where cars without stickers are parked and they don't even have main gate entry in the Security register
16/12/22, 10:31 am - +91 88613 26996: Very valid point. Needs to be deliberated and discussed with all.
16/12/22, 10:31 am - +91 98182 50395: Before any comments,read other society's by bylaws,
16/12/22, 10:32 am - +91 82917 66046: Maine aaj tak apne baalak ko nahi peeta toh aapko peetne ki Himmat kaise kar sakti hu
16/12/22, 10:32 am - +91 72763 03938: Aap nahi Kukreja uncle peet denge üòÇ
16/12/22, 10:32 am - +91 99710 22503: Kya pata kuch dekha ho Puneet ji ney, isliye dar gaye hain Aapse ü´¢
16/12/22, 10:33 am - +91 88613 26996: Then at least you have the point to make - meeting bulaya tha koi aaya naahi so we decided based on the discussion with people available and decision implemented accordingly
16/12/22, 10:37 am - +91 98737 20770: Lets keep this meeting for Sunday so that many of us will join..weekdays me to Kahan hi koi ayega.
16/12/22, 10:37 am - +91 72763 03938: Let's discuss other policies also which are implemented and going to be .
16/12/22, 10:39 am - +91 82917 66046: As of now, there is pet policy on the cards. Let me share a copy of that here by evening
16/12/22, 10:39 am - +91 82917 66046: For now please keep dropping suggestions on parking policy
16/12/22, 10:42 am - Harsh Sharma MMV: Kindly also look into the number of vistors comes in weekly so we can have dedicated cars slot in  LB or UB as told in sales pitch 
Fmt have the Data
 32slot  is not enough.
For reference same have been done in many Scoieties
16/12/22, 10:45 am - +91 72763 03938: Yes dedicated space was in the basement only.
16/12/22, 10:45 am - +91 95990 03600: For me anything that brings discipline amongst the residents is welcome. Further, if the builder has promised certain things can someone share where it has been documented. A copy of the document may be made available for the benefit of the owners.
16/12/22, 10:45 am - +91 72763 03938: But due to some residents the builder changed it to the ground floor.
16/12/22, 10:46 am - +91 99906 16200 added +91 84910 85122, +91 90039 74732 and +91 99715 58522
16/12/22, 10:47 am - Harsh Sharma MMV: In big respect to AC its very tough to manage MMV but the big reason is Highly Inefficient FMT AND BUILDER .
SO PEOPLE RAISE OBJECTIONS AS NORMAL THINGS ARE NOT PROVIDED AND MAINTAIN. 
SO would request AC team pls call Resident meeting and definitely few of us will meet you regarding some concerns in Towers and Scoiety That have been missed or not in priorty.
Sry to say.
üôèüèª
16/12/22, 10:47 am - +91 99998 21063: Actually in Society layout no parking slot on Ground floor 

They just made the parking on Ground floor to sell the  parking in basement.

They have many parking in basement if we raise point itt can be implement.
16/12/22, 10:49 am - +91 99998 21063: Just suggestion 

All staff of FMT or project should park their vehicle outside of society.
16/12/22, 10:50 am - +91 72763 03938: There is one white color scorpio which enters society without any sticker and no guard stops it.
16/12/22, 10:51 am - +91 72763 03938: No one knows who owns that.
16/12/22, 10:52 am - +91 72763 03938: And that guy doesn't look like a resident also..
16/12/22, 10:52 am - +91 99998 21063: Next time photo le lena... phir dekte h...

16/12/22, 11:59 am - +91 99994 80107: Someone plz respond
16/12/22, 11:59 am - +91 99994 80107: I am currently doing it
16/12/22, 12:01 pm - +91 83908 60077: Are they charging for guest parking?
16/12/22, 12:02 pm - +91 83908 60077: Is that even a rule? I didn't know about this. If it is this is not at all justified
16/12/22, 12:05 pm - +91 99589 98896: All they want is money no matter what.
16/12/22, 12:09 pm - +91 99998 21063: Please upload as instructions
16/12/22, 12:11 pm - +91 72763 03938: After investing more then 1Cr in flat now they will force us to live by their way. üòî

You cannot visit to the club house after 10, pay extra for guest parking, don't park a two wheeler on a dead spot.
16/12/22, 12:12 pm - +91 72763 03938: In future no pet will be allowed if registration is not done
16/12/22, 12:12 pm - +91 83908 60077: It's nothing like that. Overnight parking is allowed at most of the places. I don't know where are you talking about. When I visit my sister's place we park our car there for more than a week and nobody says anything and there are only 4 guest parking for one tower.

And I have observed for few days that the committee is comparing things with other places and cutting on our facilities. Nobody is checking how others are getting better facilities and we should also get that.

Only thing happening is others don't get this facility so we will also not get this.
16/12/22, 12:20 pm - +91 83908 60077: Ya nobody talks about penalising them. Only residents have to pay all the time
16/12/22, 12:20 pm - +91 97116 40636: Postman no.9896330676. Kindly ask from him.
16/12/22, 12:22 pm - +91 83908 60077: So, we should not invite guests at our place? Or we should ask them to leave their cars outside. Who will take the responsibility if their car gets stolen or anything. We are living in a luxurious society for having facilities like chawl or something? Guests can park their cars overnight otherwise they will have to pay
16/12/22, 12:23 pm - +91 88027 71414: <Media omitted>
16/12/22, 12:26 pm - +91 98749 52265: 1. We shouldn't forget why the AC was put in the first place - TO HAVE RESIDENTS VOICES HEARD

2. A policy/ decision having wider impact should atleast be projected to residents before being implemented - EVEN THE BIG REGULATORS (SEBI/ RBI) INVITE PUBLIC COMMENTS BEFORE IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING (its always good to have structured views; policies can't be implemented in ISOLATION - be it club timings/ parking etc.)
16/12/22, 12:35 pm - +91 99998 21063: Agree, 
Need to identify the parking which not sale till now we can use it for Guest parking till anyone not Buy. 

We need to utilize the facility available over all invested .

Now, they are just using it.

16/12/22, 2:04 pm - +91 95990 03600: We indians by nature are indisciplined lot. Discipline is something which is alien to us. Remember no one stops at the stop line on roads. It's only when a policeman is around they do becoz they know they will have to pay a price. ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§´ ‡§°‡§Ç‡§°‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∑‡§æ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§ù‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç. I am 100% with the committee and its chairman who want to bring a semblance of discipline in the society.
16/12/22, 2:07 pm - +91 99101 70875: Good üåû Morning..... 

I want to buy second hand Scooty (not the bike)... 
If any want to sell or any references kindly share... 

Thanks..
16/12/22, 2:08 pm - +91 99101 70875: Message from one of my friend in Godrej aria ,if anyone interested please DM to me.Thanks
16/12/22, 2:11 pm - +91 72763 03938: We Indians also have nature to ignore bad things happening to others unless it doesn't come to us. Once we face them then we ask for support from others.

This is our society but whenever a wrong policy or decision or incident will happen we will always stand against it. There is nothing wrong in it as we are the one who has to live with those rule in daily life.
16/12/22, 2:14 pm - +91 72763 03938: Previously club house timings changed to 10 PM without any logic and only to favor FMT guys. Now this policy and in future may be pet policy.
16/12/22, 2:20 pm - +91 98113 04666: There can not be N number of solution to any problem , we can draw 2-3 solution of each issue which are logical and ask for vote from each one of us on whatsapp only , then basis on voting feedback let‚Äôs implement.
16/12/22, 2:21 pm - +91 99909 50700: This guest parking charges is totally illogical. We are justifying everything in the name of others following it, without even thinking whether it makes sense or not. Builder has sufficient parking which are not sold yet. A lot of FMT and sales guys use it, but we will not use it, and won't raise an objection to it. Just pay for everything blindly.
16/12/22, 2:27 pm - +91 99101 70875: Sorry sir,We should proud to be Indian..same preaching can be done  in different way also..thanks..
16/12/22, 2:31 pm - +91 95990 03600: Anything happening in the society touches and affects all who are residents. Every resident for that matter has to face the consequences of a decision. No decision of the society will exclude a section and have a delayed affect on anyone. Everyone has a right to his opinion.
16/12/22, 2:34 pm - +91 95990 03600: Yes being proud of one's nation is natural. What strengths we have are there. No one can take away those strengths. But shortcomings are there too. We have a right to think and even point out about them too. Right to opinion is my fundamental right given by my constitution.
16/12/22, 2:34 pm - +91 96505 64850: Policy should be for overnight guest- 2 days free, extension allowed based on history/frequency of that unit for 3-5 days(for once in blue moon family events type scenarios) . Paid basis only after that.. 
+ We should ask builder to assign more visitor space .. atleast 5 more per Tower in basement..
16/12/22, 2:35 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: <Media omitted>
16/12/22, 2:35 pm - +91 82917 66046: Whether Indians are disciplined or not is not the point here. 

The point is a policy has been published.

It has not been implemented. 

Suggestions have been invited.

People are also being advised to give their suggestions in person or in a small group or in writing here on WhatsApp. 

Is it possible to draft policies collectively in a society where there are 750 residents? Not really.

When a framework is in place, things can be discussed. Without a framework, there is only noise, no discussion. 

The framework has been put before all of you. 
Fine tune it. 
Debate it. 
Put forth suggestions. 

Resident's meetings is a valid point and it has been acknowledged before as well. We will devise a way to make things more inclusive.

But everyone needs to understand that if you have a structure to work with, you can constructively build it to balance everyone's requirements.

Without structures, there is only chaos.
16/12/22, 2:36 pm - +91 82917 66046: These are my last 2 cents on this.
16/12/22, 2:36 pm - +91 99101 70875: Thanks..I can't argue in this matter.parked my words what I felt ..üôèüôè
16/12/22, 2:39 pm - +91 99101 74552: Let policies be formed. I hope we do not need a police help to implement here in society ü§£. We all can manage.
16/12/22, 2:39 pm - +91 98749 52265: Exactly!  All residents here are well informed and appreciate the importance/ need of policies.  The 'only disconnect' is the way it is being implemented currently (without any feedback/ structured views - since it touches all RESIDENTS).
16/12/22, 2:41 pm - +91 82917 66046: Sir except for clubhouse timings, nothing has been implemented as of today.

The policy has been published. Not implemented.

Neither is FMT putting clamps on cars as we speak, nor are they fining anybody right now. 

Implementation is a process. It is not a one day job.
16/12/22, 2:43 pm - +91 95990 03600: Yes we do not need police to manage things here. Only pleadings by a genuine person to someone encroaching on his property like parking can help us manage things.  Everyday scenario.
16/12/22, 2:43 pm - +91 72763 03938: Before publishing as a notice you should have shared it first. Now just people are opposing it you are saying that it is not implemented üòÇ
16/12/22, 2:44 pm - +91 82917 66046: Humour is a good quality to have. I appreciate it. It's a sign of intelligence.
16/12/22, 2:45 pm - +91 72763 03938: Agar koi oppose ni krta to ye policy bhi implement ho jati like club house timings.
16/12/22, 2:45 pm - +91 82917 66046: There will always be people to oppose and people to support. 
Yeh sab chalta rahega.
16/12/22, 2:45 pm - +91 82917 66046: Weren't clubhouse timings opposed? Did everyone agree to them?
16/12/22, 2:45 pm - +91 72763 03938: Ha but logo ko consent to le hi skte ho üòÇ
16/12/22, 2:48 pm - +91 82917 66046: Policy banti hai toh opposition hamesha expected hi hota hai Puneet.   People who make policies know that opposition is expected.
Those who have an ego don't manage the opposition, but crush it.

Those who work keeping their egos aside reflect over the opposition and take steps to manage it.
16/12/22, 2:49 pm - +91 82917 66046: PM ke farm laws se hum bhi kaafi kuchh seekhe hai
16/12/22, 2:52 pm - +91 72763 03938: Pura farm law hi cancel krwa diya tha opposition ne üòÇ
16/12/22, 2:53 pm - +91 98103 02049: Arni ji,  normal public does not know the realities of this case.....
16/12/22, 2:54 pm - +91 72763 03938: You guys are doing great and putting efforts but just put it for benefits of residents not otherwise.
16/12/22, 2:54 pm - +91 98749 52265: Hi Ma'am - Ideally this approach could hve been adopted to club timings too

We thought parking policy is already effective (screen shot below) ? Thanks
16/12/22, 2:54 pm - +91 98749 52265: <Media omitted>
16/12/22, 2:55 pm - +91 95990 03600: Opp
16/12/22, 2:55 pm - +91 82917 66046: Sir MyGate Ramesh ke haath mein hai. Mere haath mein hota toh yeh verbiage hi nahi hoti
16/12/22, 2:56 pm - +91 82917 66046: We have been very clear in our communication. Suggestions are welcome. Feedback is welcome. 
Tanuj Ji ne pehle din se kahaa tha best practices share kijiye.
16/12/22, 2:57 pm - +91 72763 03938: Tanuj ji to implement hi kr rhe the üòÇ
16/12/22, 2:57 pm - +91 95990 03600: So opposition didn't allow government to go ahead with farm laws. I am sure we can do wonders and start with stopping the construction of Road between 'C' tower and other towers.
16/12/22, 2:57 pm - +91 82917 66046: Now that a structure is in place, we are able to at least debate.
16/12/22, 2:58 pm - +91 72763 03938: Actually that should be the top priority for the team as they are in contact with the Builder.
16/12/22, 2:58 pm - +91 98734 89806: Let's take a pool in such scenarios which directly has an impact on resident's welfare. We are creating all the chaos & debates just by doing and implementing things what FMT is suggesting. 
First the policy to change the club timing's to 10PM without taking concurrence/feedback from people was not at all done and now the parking one.. I understand a few might be misusing it, but then all should not be at the receiving end for those few.
16/12/22, 2:59 pm - +91 72763 03938 added +91 95994 92623
16/12/22, 2:59 pm - +91 95990 03600: So let's have that our top priority too. Leave other things to secondary.
16/12/22, 3:00 pm - +91 99998 21063: Sir Ramp ban gaya h aane jaane ke liye.  aap rokne ke beat kar rahe h.....
16/12/22, 3:01 pm - +91 72763 03938: Right but it is not happening right now. Arni was saying that they were leveling manhole  but it doesn't look like that.
16/12/22, 3:01 pm - +91 72763 03938: People are living in the house on that plot.
16/12/22, 3:02 pm - +91 72763 03938: Abhi to bs diwar ban ni reh gyi vo bhi ek din koi excuse bol kr bna denge FMT wale
16/12/22, 3:02 pm - +91 95990 03600: Top topic of discussion for all of us should be the road and not other issues. As is said it should be the top priority for the committee what about us
16/12/22, 3:05 pm - +91 98103 02049: Oh is it ü§î
16/12/22, 3:05 pm - +91 95990 03600: Sir let 5hem do whatever they want to. Mark my words, the gates will be brought down in 3 months time and a wall will be erected in its place.
16/12/22, 3:12 pm - +91 82917 66046: Tanuj Ji aapka bahut khauff hai ü§£
Aur Gulshan uncle ka bhi.
I wonder why üòõ
16/12/22, 3:13 pm - +91 72763 03938: Khauff nahi h respect h üòÇüòÇ
16/12/22, 3:13 pm - +91 72763 03938: Darte to hum kisi ke baap se bhi nahi üòÇ
16/12/22, 3:15 pm - +91 98103 02049: I wish, I could üòä

Intent has been to put time and effort to organize things for betterment and reputation of our complex else am also happy getting by just like that, it's good that we all be free and do as we want.....
16/12/22, 3:16 pm - +91 82917 66046: Aapke muh mein ghee shakkar.
16/12/22, 3:18 pm - +91 82917 66046: On the revenue road front, I strongly believe the matter is close to resolution. The villagers will obviously try their best to create fear in minds of people. We shouldn't let them succeed at it.

Builder ka number sabke pass hai. 

We are raising this point with him in every meeting possible.

If anyone doubts it's a priority, please feel free to take it up individually too
16/12/22, 3:18 pm - +91 95990 03600: Thanks. When I say something I mean it.
16/12/22, 3:55 pm - +91 98103 02049: Arni ji, baat sirf itni si hai that some people are not realising that any framework/policy/rules being made are by residents only...who are also bound to comply....so that means RWA, AC etc of residents have no brains and are listing things for others only......
16/12/22, 4:10 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV: Sry to say parking policy  is only be applicable one things related to the policy  is in place till them  it will create choas i am  shock everyone knows still for sake of policy it has been made 
Like last time there will be certain repucations missed .
Beacuse parking policy is realted to rfid, slots for visitors and many more points.
And definitely dint saw chargers any where would request to share others  Scoiety policies if there is any.
Taking about framework /policy / rules.
Would like seek  Research/Reference. 
Plan of action for any circumstances happen.
Any would also request Adivisory commitee there are lot things are in bad shape and not given and not maintain kindly focus on them also.
16/12/22, 4:14 pm - +91 72763 03938: Tanuj ji baat sirf ye h ki aap ek baar draft share kr dete ya meeting bula lete so that people can suggest. But abhi bhi you are not thinking in that way and trying to justify your wrong doings. Policy should be there we all agree on that but is this policy is for residents??
16/12/22, 4:14 pm - Rachit Grover C2502 Mountville GGM: So when you say it's close to resolution can we get some insights to the conversations being held with the builder. Also, any timelines that we have to confirm that when this is going to be resolved in our favor?
16/12/22, 4:18 pm - +91 83908 60077: Sir ye koi nahi khra ki policies Mt bnaiye ya kabila bna do society ko. Abhi bhi koi kabila ni bna hua society ka. 
 residents se maintenance Li jari hai and facilities ni milri. Jo milri hai vo bhi km hoti jaegi to isme koi society ka benefit ni hai.
guest parking k paise charge kiye jare hai. Clubhouse ka time km kr diya.
Problem ka solution ni nikala jara. Bs kh diya jara hai problem hai to bnd krdo ye chiz.
Clubhouse m agar raat m koi misbehaviour hora hai to 1 ki jgh 2 gaurds rkhe jae. Ho bttmizi kre uspe heavy penalty lgai jae.
Solution nikala jae chizo ka.
Guest Parking k liye rules bnae jae. Something like agar kisi ko overnight parking krni hai to basement m slots bnae jae vha ho. Baki din m bahar kr skta hai koi thodi der k liye aya hai to.
Sir society hum sb residents ki bhi hai, only committee members ko chinta ni hai sbko hai.
Ap residents k sath discuss ni krre hai koi bhi policy implement krne se phle
16/12/22, 4:37 pm - +91 80108 90415: The problem here is we don't find solution to the problem rather creating more problems for everyone,  these policies need to be discussed before implementation, what I have experienced here in mmv is that we tend to have dictatorship regarding any policy that is to be implemented here we get a notification on mygate,  the policy makers don't discuss with others on how it will impact general life. So I hope all the policy makers can be more transparent in future  and drop the dictatorship
16/12/22, 4:37 pm - +91 99100 64668: Totally agree.  Have been saying this for a while but they just are not ready to take the feedback‚Ä¶.
16/12/22, 4:38 pm - +91 72763 03938: @918291766046 üëÜüèª
16/12/22, 4:39 pm - +91 99100 64668: See this‚Ä¶. On dec 9th.
16/12/22, 4:40 pm - +91 72763 03938: Exactly forcing anything in any way is never a right way.
16/12/22, 4:42 pm - +91 99100 64668: Puneet,  I think you have said the same thing like 100 times in one way or other today only‚Ä¶. But then only if it would fall on right ears.
16/12/22, 4:43 pm - +91 72763 03938: But still waiting for a response.
16/12/22, 4:44 pm - +91 99100 64668: I know‚Ä¶. Infact we all waiting‚Ä¶.
16/12/22, 4:57 pm - +91 98112 43919: <Media omitted>
16/12/22, 5:01 pm - +91 99994 80107: Consent ! This is the most absurd word used here ... How is it logical and even possible to take consent of each resident one by one ? There are tower representatives to take feedback and they can share with the advisory committee ...some things are logical enough to be understood and followed 

Requesting the advisory committee that it's  important for you all to have a tower representative on board with you ! To take opinions in formal way ! Everyone comes in here makes comments and leaves ! It doesn't work like this
16/12/22, 5:04 pm - +91 98112 43919: Inspite of me following up with the guards for 5 hrs, the car is still parked in my parking slot.
16/12/22, 5:08 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV: This will happen beacuse the basic thing is not there which is Flat number below Parking number. 
Pls check with main gate guards
16/12/22, 5:10 pm - +91 99867 14748: Wasnt this a drawback of the RWA we had, one way communication. That is atleast what everyone pointed and the members drew flak on the same.              
Wondering what has changed now. It seems like deja vu.
16/12/22, 5:10 pm - +91 99906 16200: This is a clear example why we need to have the parking policy active and clamps to be used on improperly parked cars.
16/12/22, 5:11 pm - +91 83908 60077: I think committee and upcoming RWA should take all this as feedback
16/12/22, 5:12 pm - +91 83908 60077: No one is here trying to blame or offend anyone. We are only trying that policies that are causing problems to residents should not be implemented
16/12/22, 5:14 pm - +91 99906 16200: If people follow basic rules and not park in others parking and visitors don't park anywhere other than the allocated slots we won't need to use clamps or put fines. But such is human nature, we need fines to keep us in check.
16/12/22, 5:14 pm - +91 95607 77552: I feel that policies are for the benefit of people and framed by the people

But sometimes it is like framed by the people only .. for the benefit of people part is missing 

I understand that policies are made to better govern the society but it should have some rationale and benefit of people in it

We are not in schools or companies that clubs closes at this, you will be fined for this, pay for extra parking of guests etc ..

We want to live in this society and home with peace and calm and enjoy .. not to be overburdened by so many rules

I am not saying rules are not important .. it is very much 
But it should be for benefit of people and should be discussed by residents first and then implemented
16/12/22, 5:15 pm - +91 95607 77552: Also to add let‚Äôs all be more vigilant and behave with each other in a nicer way, like park in your own slots , do not misuse club house etc .. so that no strict rules comes in
16/12/22, 5:15 pm - +91 83908 60077: U are correct but I only want to understand how would clamping this car help the person who is waiting for the car to be removed?
When the person will come to remove their car, it will be found locked and will find it difficult to remove. 
How is the problem being resolved?
Are we noting down anywhere? Who parked the car at wrong place? How many times? Are they a resident/guest/staff or someone else? 
If they are repeat offenders or 1st timer
16/12/22, 5:16 pm - +91 99906 16200: They will atleast know that they have caused someone else problem and now they are the one in problem. They will never do so again.
16/12/22, 5:16 pm - +91 82917 66046: This policy causes problems to following residents:
1. Those who have multiple cars/bikes and only one parking.
2. Those who are in the habit of parking their vehicles randomly as and where they wish.
3. Those who have frequent visitors who stay overnight for more than 2 nights.

The third concern is acknowledged. And we are seeing how best to rework this as suggested by Rupali, Durgesh and a couple more people so that while there is a provision in place, it isn't abused by handful of people.
16/12/22, 5:16 pm - +91 83908 60077: How can you say that so surely?
16/12/22, 5:17 pm - +91 98104 53249: üòÄ Aise nahi hota bro!!
16/12/22, 5:18 pm - +91 83908 60077: Mam we are here mainly talking about charging of guest parking
16/12/22, 5:18 pm - +91 98104 53249: Mujhe aapne inconvenience di to iska matlab ye nahi ke main aapko inconvenience du...
16/12/22, 5:18 pm - +91 82917 66046: Yes. That is covered in point 3
16/12/22, 5:19 pm - +91 95607 77552: Not as such.. I don‚Äôt have any reason out of 3 but still holistically we look 
We are more concerned on 3rd point 
And I don‚Äôt think having frequent guest should be an issue
16/12/22, 5:19 pm - +91 83908 60077: I mean even if we have frequent visitors then what is the issue. We have bought a house here. We aren't in a hostel that we can have x no. Of visitors in a month
16/12/22, 5:19 pm - +91 99906 16200: Any better solutions?
16/12/22, 5:20 pm - +91 97175 55048: What are the options for very infrequent say once in a year visitors. I am planning a mini gathering at my place where 4 to 5 car vehicles ma come for 3 to 4 hours?
16/12/22, 5:20 pm - +91 82917 66046: Maam yahaa 750 flats hai. Agar har kisi ka visitor ek hi time pe overnight rukne aa gaya toh aapko total parkings bhi kam padengi. 
Tab kaun kiske saath ladega?
Everything is subject to availability in a place like this.
16/12/22, 5:20 pm - Sanjay Sharma MMV: Sab apna flat number laga do apni apni parking mein
16/12/22, 5:21 pm - +91 82917 66046: Case to case basis pe approvals will always be given. Har society mein hota hai.
16/12/22, 5:21 pm - +91 83908 60077: *and the main concern is how and who is deciding on all this?* That only 2 days guest parking allowed, no overnight parking allowed or for reason any such thing?
16/12/22, 5:21 pm - +91 98104 53249: I have been saying this for a while now. I mean this is so easy and should have been done by now
16/12/22, 5:22 pm - +91 83908 60077: Tbhi to we are saying basement m kch slots lene k liye FMT/ builder ko push kijiye.
16/12/22, 5:22 pm - +91 95607 77552: Toh first come first serve hota
Jaise har society me hota 

Generally Aisa 1 ya 2 day hoga not every day 

Aur ye sab normal hai .. guest parking mandatory nahi ki mile
Jab hoga toh park karenge , nahi hoga toh bahar karenge
16/12/22, 5:22 pm - +91 95555 10105: Guys be assured we live in democracy and anything being implemented or imposed will be discussed and consent will be taken (if not today, but in future for sure). Don't panic as its a draft and there will be/can be an amendment.  Nothing can be set in stone, at the end of the day this place belongs to each one of us and we all will make sure everyone is happy and satisfied.  Some people will always wanted to preach ethics and show they have 250++ IQ level.  I would suggest wait and watch  üôè
16/12/22, 5:22 pm - +91 83908 60077: Ap ye btaiye paise de kar to sb ko available krwa rhe hai parking. Free m ni mil skti. Kaha se ayegi. How is that happening?
16/12/22, 5:22 pm - +91 99906 16200: But there already is an identification mark for each parking and the owner knows the parking number. What will putting flat number here help in?
16/12/22, 5:22 pm - +91 95607 77552: I mean charging for visitor parking is from what sense
16/12/22, 5:23 pm - +91 95607 77552: Thank you for acknowledging the most important part
This place belongs to all of us .. and so the rules should help all and be discussed with all
16/12/22, 5:24 pm - +91 82917 66046: Maam paise deni wali baat noted hai already. Main toh uspe baat kar hi nahi rahi.
But aap kisi bhi is size ki society mein chale jaaiye. Overnight parking ki policy hoti hi hai.
16/12/22, 5:24 pm - +91 83908 60077: Hum bhi society m hi rhte the phle. To har society m to mene esa ni dekha
16/12/22, 5:25 pm - Sanjay Sharma MMV: This message was deleted
16/12/22, 5:25 pm - +91 95607 77552: Societies me bahut rhe hai
But ese strict rules ni dekhe regarding payment etc
But glad you are saying it is being discussed and not implemented

So we will see that this gets amended in a better way for all
16/12/22, 5:26 pm - +91 99906 16200: Guest toh anyway need to park on ground floor. Unka basement parking se kya lena dena.
16/12/22, 5:27 pm - +91 99994 80107: Exactly when guest has to go in basement üòú he will anyway get stuck once access card is activated
16/12/22, 5:27 pm - +91 99994 80107: *why
16/12/22, 5:27 pm - Sanjay Sharma MMV: Apna car number laga do sir
16/12/22, 5:27 pm - Sanjay Sharma MMV: Uss car number ke alawa koi aur car park hoti hein to fine
16/12/22, 5:28 pm - +91 97175 55048: I need approval for 4 vehicles for 5 hours on 24th
16/12/22, 5:28 pm - +91 99994 80107: Simple is to put automatic boom barrier in basement as well ! So that no guests go in basement! Secondly owners park in designated area
16/12/22, 5:28 pm - +91 82917 66046: FMT mein baat kijiye. If you have a function they will always make provision. They have to.
16/12/22, 5:28 pm - +91 99906 16200: Sab ke apne parking allocated hai, uske alawa koi bhi lage toh fine laga do. Car number ya flat number  likhna hota toh parking number kyun milta.
16/12/22, 5:29 pm - +91 99994 80107: It's so simple to park in own space trust me üòúü§£
16/12/22, 5:30 pm - +91 95555 10105: Ma√°m just wait for right time and keep watching who really think for welfare  of the society we all will get an equal chance and will have a say in deciding the future of society .
16/12/22, 5:30 pm - +91 95607 77552: I agree on a point that apni car toh apne parking me hi karo
Iske lie koi rules ki zarurat nahi

Simple for everyone .. just park in your own space
16/12/22, 5:31 pm - +91 99994 80107: Imagine residents going in basement to park car but then feel let me park at someone else place...kya he hoga ü§£
16/12/22, 5:32 pm - +91 95607 77552: Thank you I am seeing since so many days

I just liked the fact that you mentioned this is for all and will be discussed with all

Otherwise the feeling and vibe it was giving that we don‚Äôt live in democracy .. just the rules are decided and follow it ..
16/12/22, 5:32 pm - +91 95607 77552: So thank you
16/12/22, 5:34 pm - +91 99998 21063: Wrong parking happen in case when anyone shift in society. üòÑ
16/12/22, 5:35 pm - +91 99994 80107: We can give one time exception lol but seriously how can people do this regularly
16/12/22, 5:35 pm - +91 99994 80107: They feel khali toh hai ...laga do

16/12/22, 5:36 pm - +91 99906 16200: Guards need to inform guests and cars without society sticker  at the entry point to park only on ground floor. This will solve the wrong parking issue drastically.
16/12/22, 5:36 pm - +91 98112 62620: <Media omitted>
16/12/22, 5:36 pm - +91 95607 77552: Yes this makes sense
16/12/22, 5:36 pm - +91 98112 62620: Dear Residents, this number  plate car is been parked in UB 475 .The UB 475 parking slot belongs to Tower -H 1902. May I please request you to kindly park the car in your parking
16/12/22, 5:37 pm - +91 99906 16200: This needs to be made mandatory at the earliest.
16/12/22, 5:37 pm - +91 95607 77552: These type of simple solutions can help üëç
No need to go extreme every time
16/12/22, 5:38 pm - +91 99906 16200: Even after that if we have wrong parking ,then penalising is the only option.
16/12/22, 5:39 pm - +91 95607 77552: We need to think on that 
Koi galti se bhi kar sakta
Not every time is intentional 

Koi repeated offender hai toh surely penalise
16/12/22, 5:39 pm - +91 82917 66046: Guard informs guests and cars without stickers to park only on ground floor. 
They still don't. 
Then what?
Tell me honestly, have you ever heard of any rule being followed in any country unless there is a deterrent?
16/12/22, 5:40 pm - +91 99906 16200: Rwa banne ke baad they can take on the builder to increase guest parking, tab tak we need to accept what we have.
16/12/22, 5:40 pm - +91 99906 16200: As i said, fine needs to be imposed.
16/12/22, 5:40 pm - +91 80108 90415: The builder has provided a designated parking for every flat,  I have 2 cars so I purchased 1 extra parking at the time of purchasing the flat,  it's a back to back parking so sometimes it's a hasel if I have to use  the 2nd car but it's manageable,  but the issue is guest parking rules I don't think putting an cost to guest parking is something unheard of,  we all have a dedicated guest room here,  if ur parents are living elsewhere and decide to come to visit u and they drive their own car it's not a practice that should be followed,  the fmt will charge u for everything but when it comes to spending money they need approvals that take months,  there is a need of mirrors in the gym as we need to check  our form while working out but the fmt is sitting on it for more than 2 months they have received quotations already from diffraction vendors but it's not approved,  so I hope people understand here that monetary charges that we spend here won't be spent on betterment of our society rather will go in JLL's pockets as profit
16/12/22, 5:40 pm - +91 98113 04666: Ye to ho hi nahi sakta , inka to Rasta basement se ho kar jata hai surface pe visitor parking ka üòú
16/12/22, 5:40 pm - +91 83908 60077: And I want to ask one more thing. Ye banquet hall k paise charge krte hai to usme parking dete hai ye log? I have seen guests parking in front of towers anywhere. 
Has any policy been designed for that? @918291766046
16/12/22, 5:41 pm - +91 82917 66046: We have told them that in case of function being organized they have to provide a parking for guests inside the complex.
That is their responsibility.
16/12/22, 5:42 pm - +91 82917 66046: If they don't provide the designated space, we can challenge them on this.
16/12/22, 5:42 pm - +91 95607 77552: I agree that charges should not be levied for guest parking

I think you saw my messages before that I am also against this point
16/12/22, 5:42 pm - +91 83908 60077: Where? In the complex but is it at the ground floor as always or in basement?
16/12/22, 5:42 pm - +91 99906 16200: Guest parking charges should be looked into and even if we impose some charges it should be minimal. But wrong parking should be fined.
16/12/22, 5:43 pm - +91 95607 77552: That‚Äôs what everyone saying you need to see repeated offenders and then penalise 

Ab kisi ne kabhi ek baar kuch galti kr di toh thode fine laga denge.. it‚Äôs not police rules here
16/12/22, 5:44 pm - +91 98112 62620: <Media omitted>
16/12/22, 5:44 pm - +91 98112 62620: Dear Residents, this number  plate car is been parked in UB 475 .The UB 475 parking slot belongs to Tower -H 1902. May I please request you to kindly park the car in your parking
16/12/22, 5:44 pm - +91 99998 21063: You can call him on my gate and request him
16/12/22, 5:45 pm - +91 80108 90415: Charge rs 20-50 per day after 2 days but 1000 rs is crazy, is this airport parking that it's costs so much....
16/12/22, 5:46 pm - +91 95607 77552: I agree 1000 is like too much
16/12/22, 5:46 pm - +91 82917 66046: Noted the point of charges and the amount. I think we can safely move on from this one.
16/12/22, 5:47 pm - +91 82917 66046: What I'm able to understand from discussions since morning:
1. Try to get more slots for visitors parking.
2. Rework the overnight parking charges and policy.
16/12/22, 5:47 pm - +91 99906 16200: Yes for guests, but wrong parking needs to have a substantial fine to prevent repeat offenders.
16/12/22, 5:47 pm - +91 95607 77552: Out of all discussions between all I feel majority of us agree 

1. Penalising repeated offenders and not all

2. Guest parking charges needs to be looked at, can‚Äôt be charged and that too this high charged
16/12/22, 5:48 pm - +91 98737 20770: Are, but why 20-50 also
16/12/22, 5:48 pm - +91 82917 66046: I don't think the first point you've mentioned has a consensus ma'am. Whether the offence is first time or second time, it is a nuisance to everyone. 
Without a deterrent in place, it will not stop.
16/12/22, 5:49 pm - +91 99906 16200: So that people don't use it as long duration parking spots and cause other visitors inconvenience.
16/12/22, 5:51 pm - +91 95607 77552: Ok if it does not have consensus .. then it is not in consensus for penalising everyone even if it is 1st or 2nd mistake as well

Also You are removing the fact that to err is humane ..
I mean galti bhi toh ho sakti kabhi kisi se .. koi new shift kia .. kisi ke guest ni gaadi chala li.. ek mauka toh sabko milta 

If repeated hai then dekh lo
16/12/22, 5:51 pm - +91 95607 77552: I think hume rule banana chiye 
‚Äò3 mistakes of my life‚Äô üòÇ

Jese hi 3 baar gaadi galat lagi .. impose the fine
16/12/22, 5:52 pm - +91 98737 20770: Agree, we need to fix some mechanism probably prior approval etc
16/12/22, 5:53 pm - +91 98104 53249: <Media omitted>
16/12/22, 5:53 pm - +91 72763 03938: @918291766046 Bike policy also need modification. At the time of purchasing  flat we were told that bikes can be parked at any dead spot.
16/12/22, 5:55 pm - +91 98104 53249: Question: I come from office and see that my parking is used by someone l. They have their car parked in it. So I will have to park elsewhere. So what will be the outcome? 

The car parked in my parking will be clamped and my car will also be clamped because it‚Äôs in someone else‚Äôs parking?
16/12/22, 5:55 pm - +91 82917 66046: In discussion with Essence on this.
16/12/22, 5:55 pm - +91 99906 16200: In that case fmt needs to be contacted and they need to allot a temporary parking for you.
16/12/22, 5:56 pm - +91 98104 53249: Got it.
16/12/22, 5:56 pm - +91 99994 80107: That's the struggle here ! What can't people use  their own parking! Kya milta hai kisi ke space mai parking karne se
16/12/22, 5:56 pm - +91 99963 76383: but the person who parked weong should be fined as because of him actual person is suffering
16/12/22, 5:57 pm - +91 99906 16200: Jinke paas 2 car hai and 1 parking, dikkat unhe hai ü§£
16/12/22, 5:57 pm - +91 98112 62620: In other condominiums people buy extra car parking if they have more than 1 car
16/12/22, 5:58 pm - +91 98104 53249: 8 lakh ki car and 5 lakh Ki parking ü•π
16/12/22, 5:58 pm - +91 99906 16200: Here also many have bought, but those who haven't will have problems now.
16/12/22, 5:59 pm - +91 99994 80107: I had two cars few months back and i took other space on rent ! And others can do as well
16/12/22, 6:01 pm - +91 99906 16200: Yes. This should be done by others also.

16/12/22, 6:06 pm - +91 99998 21063: I already purchase 2 parking as purchased the flat

16/12/22, 6:15 pm - +91 98185 64333: They  making  d  rules  on paper  sheet  practically  so many things not possibleüôä
16/12/22, 6:18 pm - +91 98737 20770: Why we are agreeing to any cost, ar√™ let‚Äôs fix some mechanism which will be in favour of all residents.
16/12/22, 6:18 pm - +91 99998 21063: Which parking not sold till time we can use for Guest parking
16/12/22, 6:19 pm - +91 99906 16200: A list of these slots can be made available after discussion with fmt.
16/12/22, 6:21 pm - +91 98185 64333: All   rules  r  imposed  with voting  thru  out   voting  by mapsko  family then it's  applicable if  everyone in favour of new rules........
16/12/22, 6:21 pm - +91 98737 20770: Do we have enough parking slots?? what happen if we all start paying Rs 50 for our visitor for 2-3 weeks..
16/12/22, 6:22 pm - +91 98185 64333: Gud idea
16/12/22, 6:22 pm - +91 99906 16200: Fmt will have to provide slots if they charge.
16/12/22, 6:23 pm - +91 99906 16200: And they ideally will give long stay approval only if they have space.

16/12/22, 10:29 pm - +91 88005 87720: There is no question of paying a single penny for guest parking‚Ä¶.It seems impractical approach‚Ä¶It‚Äôs a HOME not a hotel,mall or asylum that visitors who come to meet us and want to stay will pay for parking‚Ä¶
I think if this is what is discussed and thought over also then we should have a third button policy while walking in common area so that no one can see each other which may result to conflict‚Ä¶.it seems the committee is trying create unrest within society‚Ä¶.
16/12/22, 10:32 pm - +91 88005 87720: I agree with Gaurav‚Ä¶ and we should not charge a single penny
16/12/22, 10:35 pm - +91 98185 64333: Right üëç
16/12/22, 10:35 pm - +91 95607 77552: Totally agree
No guest parking charges to be there
16/12/22, 10:36 pm - +91 96501 45123 added +91 94314 80253
16/12/22, 10:38 pm - +91 96505 64850: But there should be some control so that people don't start using guest spot for their additional Cars.. if not money then some other way, right? Otherwise no spot will be available for genuine guests/visitors. I think that's what intention is of policy, maybe some other better way can be suggested.. Let's not get triggered & respect folks who are putting their time and efforts.. & provide genuine & logical suggestions.. üôè
16/12/22, 10:38 pm - +91 72763 03938: As a resident I just want to know from committee members what else they have achieved after committee formation other than just forcing Policies?? STP water is still dirty, Guards are doing wrong entries, most of the plants are dead due to dirty water etc.. There is a long list which needs to be taken care first.
16/12/22, 10:41 pm - +91 82917 66046: You have two close friends in the committee. Why don't you ask them?
16/12/22, 10:42 pm - +91 82917 66046: @919910170875 please tell Puneet what the committee does
16/12/22, 10:42 pm - +91 82917 66046: And what it has achieved or hasn't achieved?
16/12/22, 10:42 pm - +91 72763 03938: Btao bhai @919910170875
16/12/22, 10:42 pm - +91 88005 87720: Does that mean that we the so called educated people lacks the basic moral sense to make choices so that no one is affected‚Ä¶.We should have an integrity so that we should make sure what ever we do in the common area does not affect others
16/12/22, 10:43 pm - +91 88005 87720: Highly negative and trying to proof once supremacy over others‚Ä¶
16/12/22, 10:44 pm - +91 95607 77552: Nobody is getting triggered .. people are just facing issues with such decisions which is not discussed and straight forward put in front of us ..
Also Putting time and effort does not mean that the decisions and policies are right .. 
the committee is focusing on issues and dealing  like hostel and PGs or companies ..there people have disconnect 

Like charging 1000 per day for guest parking .. 
people have problem with these type of policies
16/12/22, 10:45 pm - +91 95607 77552: Putting control does not mean make it a hostel or company 
It should be treated as a resident living space which belongs to all of us
16/12/22, 10:48 pm - +91 95607 77552: Ek do ki wrong parking should not cost to others..
I think you guys want an ideal place where no mistakes are there 
Full control is there
It does not happen in real world

You will get different type of people and you would have to deal one on one with them

You can‚Äôt make such policy for controlling  mistakes of few, cause problem to the rest of the world
16/12/22, 10:49 pm - +91 88005 87720: I think we should re look the parking charges and make it 1 lakh per day post 2 days‚Ä¶.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Once the policy is out no one will come to visit us at such high parking charges and we will have all space of us‚Ä¶
16/12/22, 10:49 pm - +91 95607 77552: If some one is repeatedly doing mistakes etc talk to them 
Deal with them
They will be very few

And for these few people you can‚Äôt make such policy which is causing problem to majority
16/12/22, 10:50 pm - +91 88005 87720: Just like transport authority issue challan to repeat offenders
Also I think we should get the same registered in court so our residents to are at fault visit court to clear off the dues‚Ä¶
16/12/22, 10:51 pm - +91 72763 03938: And also impound those cars until they don't pay fine üòÇ
16/12/22, 10:52 pm - +91 96505 64850: So that's not per day that's for 7 days .which comes out ~4K per month.. Normal rent for extra Parking nowadays is what around 2-3K per month.. Usually calculation to dissuade people for using regularly is make it double.. It's not that outrageous.. Maybe some modifications on allowing couple weeks per household on one-off basis free for long term types of tweaks are needed..
16/12/22, 10:52 pm - +91 88005 87720: WHY to pay?????
16/12/22, 10:52 pm - +91 95607 77552: Our point is no charges for guest parking
16/12/22, 10:53 pm - +91 95607 77552: This is residential not company
16/12/22, 10:54 pm - +91 95607 77552: Don‚Äôt make such rules 
Even 1000 for 7 days also too high 

And no sense for it
16/12/22, 10:54 pm - +91 99998 21063: Bhai already parking available in basement which not sell yet . We have to use it for Guest parking why we have to pay.

No one force to pay
16/12/22, 10:54 pm - +91 72763 03938: @918291766046  Let's also make a policy for FMT like if we didn't get services for which we are paying maintenance then they should also be fined and it will be deducted from our maintainance. Kr skte ho kya ye?
16/12/22, 10:55 pm - +91 98737 20770: Agree, why to pay even a single penny..we all are paying good amount of maintenance charge‚Ä¶This is ‚ÄúTanashahi‚Äù..
16/12/22, 10:56 pm - +91 99998 21063: It's my request please don't be personal.. 

Don't know who's close friends 

We're residence here we know each other don't mean we target to someone
16/12/22, 10:57 pm - +91 88005 87720: Should we order some clamps through Amazon and start monitoring around the society like a traffic police and clamp the wheels where ever found parked incorrectly without even mentioning the way to remove it so that the visitor finds it difficult to go and we get more money from that visitors‚Ä¶üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
16/12/22, 10:57 pm - +91 99998 21063: Ask to FMT/Project team  1st park there vehicle outside the society.  Why our residence or Guest
16/12/22, 10:58 pm - +91 95607 77552: Sahi me
Kya tanashahi laga rakha hai

Kaun laa rha hai ese rules .. matlab kuch bhi rules lgaye ja rhe 
Kuch bhi follow krne bol rhe
Itne toh country ke rules strict nahi hai
16/12/22, 10:58 pm - +91 82917 66046: Sir humble requests have no place in this society. Humble requests have been made to submit suggestions.
Humble requests have been made to keep conversation civil and be serious when we discuss things. 
Humble requests have been made to come and meet the committee in person of unhappy.
16/12/22, 10:58 pm - +91 96505 64850: I think if u read for guests it's free upto 2 days.. Usually Cars parked for months are not guests but additional Cars & that's where some control is needed. As I said if not money then atleast some prior approval wid some proof or something.. Otherwise we already had situation all spots were occupied..
16/12/22, 10:59 pm - +91 82917 66046: Instead there is only taunting.
16/12/22, 10:59 pm - +91 88007 62986: Just a quick question out of curiosity - is the policy implemented?? Or is it open for discussion and suggestions??
16/12/22, 10:59 pm - +91 82917 66046: I have personally mentioned 10 times since morning that guest policy will be reworked.
16/12/22, 11:00 pm - +91 98737 20770: Mam, clamping also‚Ä¶.
16/12/22, 11:00 pm - +91 99998 21063: Posted on my gate for implementation.  Please check my gate
16/12/22, 11:00 pm - +91 99101 70875: Arni , I think you are also good friend of them...and you are most eligible and talented  person in society  to convince...ü§£
16/12/22, 11:00 pm - +91 82917 66046: If mentioning this has no value and we want to go in circles on the same subject, is this a discussion?
16/12/22, 11:01 pm - +91 95607 77552: And fine also
16/12/22, 11:01 pm - +91 82917 66046: Yes I am a friend too. And I have spoken to everyone who has asked me what the committee is doing and what challenges it is facing.
16/12/22, 11:01 pm - +91 72763 03938: Aap meeting bula lo na yaar
16/12/22, 11:02 pm - +91 99906 16200: @advisory team, please keep a meeting as otherwise this topic won't ever end.
Many people here will give suggestions which will be the betterment for all.
16/12/22, 11:02 pm - +91 99998 21063: Bhai take sleep don't waste time.
16/12/22, 11:02 pm - +91 95607 77552: Because we feel that even from your end we are getting the final decision and conclusion 

And no relevant policies 

So you people will have to listen to the opposition because these policies will affect all of us directly
16/12/22, 11:02 pm - +91 88005 87720: No point of meeting for this‚Ä¶We have bigger issue that could be related to our security and well being but we are discussing on this guest parking issue‚Ä¶.
16/12/22, 11:03 pm - +91 99906 16200: As all your time spent on important discussions and functioning will go to waste if people feel lack of connect.
16/12/22, 11:03 pm - +91 99101 70875: They are simply asking meeting nothing more than that...if we are right then what is the issue ...I don't know why are we making things so completed...
16/12/22, 11:03 pm - +91 99101 70875: *complicated
16/12/22, 11:04 pm - +91 95607 77552: So fir 2 days wala rule kaha se aaya
Jo month se lagaye hai unko bologe na aaplog

Genuinely koi guest 7 days ruka hai wo kyun de parking fee

Wohi toh bol rhe hum log ki unlog kuch ko thik karne ke lie baki jinke genuine guest jai wo kyun suffer Kate
16/12/22, 11:05 pm - +91 89290 34569: Guys, are we in kindergarten?? Making personal attacks of things not being discussed or implemented. The committee is here to solve for the entire society without any personal benefits to anyone! Is there an agreement there or anyone has any juvenile questions?
16/12/22, 11:05 pm - +91 98113 04666: Also we should get an official communication that policy will be relooked and then will be implement as right now we have communication on my gate that this is the final new policy .
16/12/22, 11:06 pm - +91 99101 70875: @919818250395 uncle please arrange a meeting with residence to get the confidence..we have full confidence in you...pleasee
16/12/22, 11:06 pm - +91 99998 21063: We think on how to increase no of parking . Guest can stay for 7 days. 

Which look feasible so why we making it complicated
16/12/22, 11:06 pm - +91 88007 62986: It looks like that
16/12/22, 11:07 pm - +91 99998 21063: Sir Target achive ho gaya üòÇüòÇ
16/12/22, 11:10 pm - +91 95607 77552: I think the policies people are not finding right that‚Äôs why so many people are opposing 

And you should consider that
But instead of that we are getting the vibe that it is implemented you have to follow it etc. 
and also we are getting taunts on our suggestion and opposition
16/12/22, 11:10 pm - +91 98737 20770: But one hour is still left.. üòÇüòÇ
16/12/22, 11:10 pm - +91 89290 34569: @917276303938: Let‚Äôs discuss one on one. I think you have way too many questions. I guess it‚Äôs not what you say but how you say it. And if you believe that making personal remarks on @918291766046 will let you hide behind the ability of free speech; let‚Äôs just get this out once and for all!
16/12/22, 11:11 pm - +91 89290 34569: And you believe that the committee will not do any good for the society for no reason?
16/12/22, 11:12 pm - +91 88007 62986: Together as a one family we can raise our concerns and tell the committee that we need their support in making life simpler at MMV and trust them for what they bring to the table and not question their integrity! If we are not ok with something please bring it out in a way that everyone feels respected and not demeaned
16/12/22, 11:12 pm - +91 72763 03938: @918929034569  I was just asking questions. I never did personal attack and if still it feel then I am sorry for that @918291766046 . Nahi krta abhi koi message üôèüèªüôèüèª
16/12/22, 11:13 pm - +91 88005 87720: agreed but it should be prior to making it official,, like a statement of my gate‚Ä¶
16/12/22, 11:13 pm - +91 89290 34569: I think the tonality of messages is other way around! Committee members coming with suggestions and others taunting them for implementing rather that understanding where they are coming from and their intent to make this a better place to live!
16/12/22, 11:15 pm - +91 95607 77552: Not sure .. 
plus the committee formulated is an advisory committee 

It is not that what you people decide and think is good for society and should be followed 

Also what do you think that if we are not in committee we do. It want good for society 

The people opposing does not want good for society
16/12/22, 11:16 pm - +91 89290 34569: I think we should just stop! Meet the committee members and understand with a peaceful mind why they are doing what they are doing. Rather going in circles! I believe for most of us this is a first time buy and these are teething issues that can be resolved to make this a better place from a long term perspective!
16/12/22, 11:16 pm - +91 95607 77552: We also want good for society
We also have no reasons to think bad for society 

It‚Äôs not like if we are not in committee we have other intentions
16/12/22, 11:16 pm - +91 95607 77552: Ok
16/12/22, 11:17 pm - +91 88007 62986: We can always say that right - that we are not happy with it and would want the committee to rework and come up with better solutions - simple.
16/12/22, 11:17 pm - +91 98737 20770: On a very serious note, clamping the wheels is a very dangerous thing to do, just assume  if the said person gets into an emergency where they need to go to hospital or rush for other emergency do we have system in place who can immediately come and unclamp the car in few minutes.
16/12/22, 11:17 pm - +91 89290 34569: I agree! But chatting on WhatsApp will resolve this?
16/12/22, 11:18 pm - +91 95607 77552: I think the topic started on WhatsApp
That‚Äôs the easiest way to connect
16/12/22, 11:18 pm - +91 95607 77552: We can say that if it would have been discussed with us prior to implementing 

Not like after seeing as an advisory from FMT
16/12/22, 11:19 pm - +91 88005 87720: We don‚Äôt have issue but there is money involved and it will not look good for our visitors‚Ä¶
There are many decisions that were taken in past but not much have been questioned‚Ä¶
But this is not expected at all..
And what ever be the decision I am not going to adhere to it‚Ä¶
16/12/22, 11:19 pm - +91 99716 67972: ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
16/12/22, 11:19 pm - +91 88007 62986: A humble request - Let‚Äôs make the conversations constructive here which leads to positive discussions and outcomes
16/12/22, 11:19 pm - +91 99998 21063: Same many people suggested in whole discussion for residence meeting but they not responding for that .

If they confirm I hope all wait for meeting and discuss the concern. 

Before that also so many meeting happen
16/12/22, 11:19 pm - +91 99716 67972: üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ
16/12/22, 11:20 pm - +91 95607 77552: Hope to see from both the sides .. 
Policy supporters and policy opposers üôè
16/12/22, 11:21 pm - +91 95607 77552: That positive talk is there
16/12/22, 11:21 pm - +91 89290 34569: And to not make this a debate and work out an outcome based approach!
16/12/22, 11:21 pm - +91 88007 62986: Sir that‚Äôs my point - majority people are not happy - let‚Äôs say that in a way which leads to healthy discussions and outcomes
16/12/22, 11:22 pm - +91 99716 67972: Sorry phn was with my sonüò¨
16/12/22, 11:22 pm - +91 95607 77552: Thanks
16/12/22, 11:22 pm - +91 99101 70875: Definitely will discuss and convince to @919811307198 @919899016444 @919810302049 @919818250395  for general body meeting to close this issue and get the consent in favor of all...I am sure they will arrange the same as we are committed for welfare of society...
16/12/22, 11:22 pm - +91 99716 67972: I think committee members already said 1000 times to come and meet in library they sit there everyday
16/12/22, 11:22 pm - +91 99716 67972: What kind of meeting thing are we expecting again and again
16/12/22, 11:23 pm - +91 98737 20770: @AC, pls call a formal meeting on Sunday..pls confirm place/time..
16/12/22, 11:23 pm - +91 99101 70875: Sure...
16/12/22, 11:25 pm - +91 88005 87720: I don‚Äôt think we should meet on this topic as this is in no way will be followed and will only create ruckus‚Ä¶
16/12/22, 11:26 pm - +91 98103 30575: <Media omitted>
16/12/22, 11:28 pm - +91 99997 57040: Kyn bhai guest aa rahey hain kya üòâ
16/12/22, 11:28 pm - +91 88005 87720: This is what is all about being in one society and living like a family‚Ä¶
Good hear that your belongings are safe‚Ä¶
16/12/22, 11:48 pm - Rachit Grover C2502 Mountville GGM: I agree with Sushil and that's my observation during any conversation with the RESPECTED COMMITTEE members. If you have been given responsibility for leading issues from the front the residents have rights to know about what the outcomes are after the meetings. 
I'm not very happy with the response given to Puneet - I have no friends who I can go and ask in any matter so shall I stay uninformed.
16/12/22, 11:56 pm - Rachit Grover C2502 Mountville GGM: @918291766046 ji still awaiting a response on this as I don't know what minutes of meeting are from your meeting with the builder? If these are shared earlier can you quote that so I can read as well. Thanks
17/12/22, 12:00 am - +91 80108 90415: To the advisory committee,  plz let us know where will the money collected from penalties be used? Will it go to fmt or any other fund? Why r u guys so adamant for monetary penalties on visitors , pets is there a shortage of funds with JLL ? I heard they r paying the staff salaries late,  is this a way of collecting additional money
17/12/22, 12:11 am - +91 82917 66046: <Media omitted>
17/12/22, 12:13 am - +91 82917 66046: This message was posted by me in discussions on MyGate. 
In Hindi.
In English. 
Also shared on WhatsApp 
Also shared on Telegram
In both languages.
17/12/22, 12:13 am - +91 82917 66046: It was clearly mentioned policy will be notified and suggestions and feedback will be welcome.
17/12/22, 12:14 am - +91 82917 66046: So to answer the question, the policy was notified through MyGate with clear information that it is open to suggestions/feedback.
17/12/22, 12:14 am - +91 82917 66046: I don't know why people got the vibe that it is implemented without their opinions being given any importance.
17/12/22, 12:18 am - +91 82917 66046: We have implemented NOTHING as of now. It has only been notified.
17/12/22, 12:20 am - +91 99721 67314: I thought it was published on MyGate and residents were to adhere to it‚Ä¶ ? How can they publish on MyGate like that? This has created lot of confusion.
17/12/22, 12:21 am - +91 99721 67314: <Media omitted>
17/12/22, 12:21 am - +91 82917 66046: Sir I do not control verbiage Ramesh Malik chooses to use when notifying things. 
This note was circulated on all platforms before Ramesh sent a message.
17/12/22, 12:22 am - +91 82917 66046: And I have been reiterating this several times since morning that nothing is cast in stone.
17/12/22, 12:22 am - +91 82917 66046: But no one wants to read that.
17/12/22, 12:22 am - +91 82917 66046: Instead I get to hear that now that people are opposing you are saying it is not implemented.
17/12/22, 12:22 am - +91 82917 66046: Are we children?
17/12/22, 12:23 am - +91 88613 26512: @918291766046 people got the vibe that it‚Äôs implemented because the policy attached in the notice is signed by AO‚Ä¶ something which is signed by AO means it‚Äôs official and people have to follow that‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs not get into that debate and I appreciate the fact that committee has agreed to look into the policy again and they will be revising it based on the opinion of the residents‚Ä¶
17/12/22, 12:24 am - +91 82917 66046: Fair point ma'am. We can keep this in mind for the future for the sake of everyone's comfort.
17/12/22, 12:26 am - +91 95607 77552: Thanks for sharing this but as messaged by different people above we got the feeling from FMT notice .. and that‚Äôs why everyone was debating
Something mentioned so clearly on MyGate by FMT with policy signature etc becomes a policy

That‚Äôs why people were debating 

But thanks for closing the debate that this will be looked upon and it‚Äôs not a policy
17/12/22, 12:29 am - +91 98112 62620: Please share this parking policy doc
17/12/22, 12:29 am - +91 99998 21063: If possible ask to FMT remove the policy  from my gate notice till the revise policy will come.
17/12/22, 12:29 am - +91 82917 66046: Noted.
17/12/22, 12:45 am - +91 99721 67314: My few cents: 

Let‚Äôs rather have a better inspection/policing for unauthorized parking!

If there is a resident allowing same guest multiple times or for longer time , it doesn‚Äôt mean his/her guests aren‚Äôt genuine guests. Society should not try to limit the number of days a resident can invite guests! 

Restrictive policies make living difficult, and better alternative is effective policing‚Ä¶

Better inspection / policing / maintenance will at least :
- Ensure no unidentified car is parked inside.
- Resident cars will be parked inside only by better and regular inspection and effective maintenance with no need of penalties.
- Repeat offenders can also be identified by effective inspection and then they can be dealt with discussion/warnings or even penalty (if warnings don‚Äôt  help) with proper justification given.
- Give actual picture on where we stand on our visitor parking requirement and then can act accordingly by liaising with builder.
- Ensure to reduce incorrect parking incidents as well as driving in wrong direction - in my last society, no one could drive in wrong direction for more than 50 meters as guards would stop him/her. 

Let‚Äôs work collectively and help make MMV the best we can. 

Good Night All! üôÇ
17/12/22, 12:49 am - +91 95607 77552: Thank you for this
We are on the same page regarding this .. 
There should be no restrictive policy for resident‚Äôs guests 

Nobody can ask for payment or restricting them for 2 days, 5 days , 7 days etc etc 

It‚Äôs a resident living society 
Guests can come and go anytime
17/12/22, 12:52 am - +91 88005 87720: Absolutely right but I think it‚Äôs not the objective here‚Ä¶
When nothing is done for the problem such as revenue road or common area charges‚Ä¶Additional monetary hassle is being planned on grounds of baseless rules‚Ä¶
17/12/22, 12:59 am - +91 98734 89806: I would suggest if we keep an open house meeting with all the residents once the committee creates an initial draft of the policy and in the same meeting the policy can be reviewed/argued/debated/modified and published. Similar to what we did while creating the Yoga room policy draft.
17/12/22, 1:03 am - +91 88005 87720: I don‚Äôt really believe we are even discussing on this issue‚Ä¶This will only create problem in future‚Ä¶ As when ever anyone‚Äôs guest will come then either the owner or the guest will have to shell money from their pocket like we pay to hotel when we go for stay‚Ä¶I think we are working for FMT instead of thinking of the well being of this society‚Ä¶
17/12/22, 1:05 am - +91 99998 21063: Let's finish the decision,  I hope in revise policy all concern to be adress..üòÑ

17/12/22, 1:26 am - +91 91300 12979: Agreed with the point.

It is illogical on guest parking charges. Means our society is a mall or a shopping place for relatives and the guest are coming so we will tell them to pay for their parking or we will pay. 


Woowwww gr8 

Matlab kuchh b. Just to collect the money.
17/12/22, 1:40 am - +91 91300 12979: Har kisi k relatives 1 saath kese aayenge. Sab to 1 dusre ko jaante nahi ki sab aapas me pahle mahurat nikalenge or fir aayenge.

@AO, pls confirm the timings for Sunday meeting..
If someone says that this policy was just a draft, its not correct at all, when the policy was published on MyGate, it was clearly written ‚Äú Residents are requested to adhere the policy‚Äù
If people did not oppose then this policy would have been implemented like Club house timing policy, now AO is saying it was just a draft..
As per policy ‚Äúwe need to pay parking charges in our own society, does it make any sense??
Clamping and fine also needs to be removed from so called existing draft..

We don't have network in basement so we all need to take care
17/12/22, 9:41 am - +91 98737 20770: This is a very serious issue, probably they came from revenue road side..
Don‚Äôt think so from main gate it‚Äôs possible..
17/12/22, 9:42 am - +91 84477 31434: Very true‚Ä¶.. , I am sure you came forward and handed over to security otherwise they would have   Stopped some female !
17/12/22, 9:43 am - +91 99990 90735: Yes but ideally guard is assigned near revenue road gate‚Ä¶ might be another failure of our so called security
17/12/22, 9:44 am - +91 99998 21063: We need to check they are outsider or friend of residence
17/12/22, 9:44 am - +91 84477 31434: Let‚Äôs follow up with security and get the details phaji ‚Ä¶ we should not leave this‚Ä¶

17/12/22, 9:52 am - +91 88027 71414: This is getting common now with revenue road open. 2weeks back also similar incident happened and tower guards has a heated exchange and pushed the village locals out. Guards stationed at revenue road gate says they can't risk their life for this salary
17/12/22, 9:53 am - +91 99963 76383: we should have fencing all around
17/12/22, 9:53 am - +91 88027 71414: That was also opposite Tower D and E and someone also mentioned in this grp at that time

17/12/22, 10:18 am - +91 98719 89782: Its seems that Builder has installed dummy camera and security agency has put dummy guard ij CCTV room. Why security personal are clueless in every incident when camera has been installed at main junction as per so called  3 tier security given by Builder. What our administrator and committee are doing on this or they are only busy with making laws and but zero implementation. 
Requested from committe to find the culprit and send written complain to local police. Such act can't be tolerated even if done by any guest.
17/12/22, 10:19 am - +91 99998 21063: I will go FMT within 5 minutes

They did misbehave with I can manage,  I don't have such ego

17/12/22, 12:09 pm - +91 99994 80107: This notice shud be a red flag to AC before they take FMT account under them or RWA, even after so many reminders there are still outstanding payment! However services are still functional as the builder has capacity to arrange funds and run it ! Tower I is our breather honestly until that finishes and is completely sold builder has to keep upkeep at any cost ! So leverage this situation accordingly

17/12/22, 8:57 pm - Saurabh Dawar MMV: Very sad that advisory committee is leaving. It is just setting a very bad example. That if residents don't agree with policies that are made by  committee then they will resign. You all were doing good work and there should be space for suggestions, and improvements. Only thing that people were asking for was a meeting with commitee. It was mistake of FMT to publish it like a policy and you made it very clear. I would request people not to leave committee like this. And others also please stop making personal commentsüôè
17/12/22, 9:06 pm - +91 89290 34569: This is great news, now that the advisory committee no longer exits! Brilliant job guys! 

All the efforts, late evening meetings (when all of the committee members knew how imp it is to be with the family and still dedicated their personal time) follow up with multiple stakeholders and hearing taunts & personal attacks about their inability to resolve now comes to a full stop! 

For most of us this is the first time we bought a home and given what has transpired since the Commitee was created is an absolute shame! The entire concept of co living has been defeated hands down. 

Cheers to converting MMV into DDA or worse a JJ Colony in years to come! Peace out!
17/12/22, 9:10 pm - +91 99994 80107: Going by this i wonder if RWA will ever be formed ! People will hesitate to participate in elections
17/12/22, 9:13 pm - +91 99990 90735: <Media omitted>
17/12/22, 9:14 pm - +91 99990 90735: Pls remove this car from my space and on top of that no parking sticker‚Ä¶ security lapse
17/12/22, 9:24 pm - +91 97776 09949: Anyone have small drilling machine?
17/12/22, 9:27 pm - +91 84477 31434: Inform gate Security , they will lock the tyre for fine !
17/12/22, 9:28 pm - +91 84477 31434: Infact you will get to know the flat number !
17/12/22, 9:28 pm - +91 99990 90735: Got it
17/12/22, 9:28 pm - +91 84477 31434: Hahaha ‚Ä¶. Cool who was the culprit
17/12/22, 9:29 pm - +91 97390 09182: I always felt they are doing good. You will be missed for sure. I hope the people who ganged up will contribute now!
17/12/22, 9:29 pm - +91 99998 80794: This message summarize everything for both.
Folks in advisory needs to understand that these shit happens they just can't leave.
For Others watch your words
17/12/22, 9:30 pm - +91 99906 16200: Very sad to see that the Advisory committee has resigned,  we are seeing a repeat of what happened with the first RWA. This time the members were not selected by the builder and normal residents like us had volunteered for the betterment of our society. 
Even if we have a new elected RWA in the future, this will happen again as we've formed a habit.
17/12/22, 9:32 pm - +91 99990 90735: Leave it paaji ho jata h kabhi kabhi
17/12/22, 9:32 pm - +91 82917 66046: Deepak Ji aapki parking system mein do flats ko allot hui hai. 
They will solve this tomorrow with sales team.
17/12/22, 9:33 pm - +91 82917 66046: Jawahar will help you with alternate slot for now
17/12/22, 9:33 pm - +91 82917 66046: Aaj meeting mein yeh discuss hua tha
17/12/22, 9:33 pm - +91 82917 66046: üôèüèª
17/12/22, 9:37 pm - +91 99990 90735: As of now I have parked it in visitor but hopefully I will park in my space LB 479
17/12/22, 9:38 pm - +91 99990 90735: Tomorrow onwards
17/12/22, 9:38 pm - +91 83908 60077: If committee has resigned, how will the RWA form?
17/12/22, 9:48 pm - +91 98737 20770: No one has asked for AC resignation, it‚Äôs seems if residents don't agree with any policies or decisions which has made by committee then they will resign. There should be space for residents suggestions. Only thing what all residents were asking for a discussion on published policy.
If we had discussed this policy before publishing on FMT, then all these issues would not have happened.
No one is saying AC is not doing a good job..
We still want that the committee should continue to run and do its work as before.
17/12/22, 9:52 pm - +91 99994 80107: Well they did agree that policy has been published in hurry and even though it was mentioned that it's shud be followed with immediate effect! They time and again said let's discuss but unfortunately the bashing didn't stop from many of us ! People go personal here very often! So they felt it's the right thing to do
17/12/22, 9:59 pm - +91 98737 20770: This message was deleted
17/12/22, 10:16 pm - +91 88007 62986: Patience amongst people in MMV will bring about a positive change. Let‚Äôs trust people who take initiatives and not make them feel that by leading from the front they did a mistake
17/12/22, 10:17 pm - +91 99710 22503: Same thing happened while last RWA member were there, Rupali and Tarun were working tirelessly but people made sure that they must resign and now the same thing happened to the advisory committee. Now Sane people who force them resigned will shed crocodile tears.Shame in you guys
17/12/22, 10:17 pm - +91 88007 62986: How you say something always superseeds what you say!
17/12/22, 10:19 pm - +91 88007 62986: We all are responsible people living together and we need to give benefit of doubt at times for people to come back with alternatives
17/12/22, 10:20 pm - +91 88007 62986: Anyone who contributes for betterment of society has no Personal Agenda - All they want is that we all have a comfortable life in MMV
17/12/22, 10:21 pm - +91 88007 62986: Let‚Äôs support them with positive and constructive inputs and make them stronger with our unconditional support.
17/12/22, 10:24 pm - +91 88007 62986: TRUST is a very powerful emotion - and the moment the first letter gets removed - it is RUST‚Ä¶ I am sure we do not want that
17/12/22, 10:24 pm - +91 98737 20770: This message was deleted
17/12/22, 10:27 pm - +91 88007 62986: I would personally request the Committee to reconsider their decision of discontinuing their unconditional and honest support for the society‚Ä¶ we are always there with you all with positive and constructive support without any personal comments. üôèüôèüôèüôè
17/12/22, 10:32 pm - +91 88005 87720: I don‚Äôt think anyone should be ashamed..Unlike what was quoted‚Ä¶ Well, Whenever a person performs any job they are bound to get appreciation and criticism‚Ä¶and if anyone can not take criticism and want people to adhere to what ever is being decided by the people authorised‚Ä¶ Then there is no point  of taking the responsible position‚Ä¶ 
And it‚Äôs good that people stood for the right‚Ä¶Proud of all‚Ä¶
17/12/22, 10:37 pm - +91 88007 62986: üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
17/12/22, 10:38 pm - +91 89290 34569: Profound!
17/12/22, 10:41 pm - +91 95607 77552: I think people are asking not to make personal remarks and blame..

But in fact the people who opposed are the ones getting personal remarks and blames .. like please be ashamed and stuff like because of them the committee got dissolved etc etc

It‚Äôs very natural if you have taken any decision which is not right in the eyes of other residents or if they feel it is not logical and rationale, then they will oppose

You need to have the ability to take criticism as well if such decisions are made which people feel is not right 

Even government decisions receive criticism and they modify their policies .. do not start blaming people who opposed
17/12/22, 10:45 pm - +91 88007 62986: I would  only say - it is always easier said then done üôèüôè
17/12/22, 10:45 pm - +91 99994 80107: Mayank ji no one would accept a personal remark ! It's simple ...policies are made ..they are opposed too  and discussed and a consensus is arrived!
17/12/22, 10:46 pm - +91 99994 80107: Anyway let's see what is next for all of us
17/12/22, 10:47 pm - +91 89290 34569: Profound again!
17/12/22, 10:49 pm - +91 88007 62986: Indeed
17/12/22, 10:51 pm - +91 95607 77552: Thank you
17/12/22, 10:58 pm - +91 88005 87720: Very true
17/12/22, 11:25 pm - +91 88602 28008: Reminder!

17/12/22, 11:38 pm - +91 82917 66046: Yahaa har koi ek society mein rehta hai. Aapka padosi. Aapke dost. Aapke bachcho ke dost. 
Inhi logo mein se kuchh log apna personal time deke kuchh kaam karne ke bhaav se saamne aate hai. 

Aap unse poochho ki koi kaam kyu nahi ho raha.

Aap unse poochho ki kisi kaam mein waqt kyu lag raha hai.

Aap unse poochho ki kami kyu hai.

Aap unse kaho ki policy mein XYZ theek nahi hai. Change hona chahiye.
Personally kaho.
Is group pe kaho.
WhatsApp pe personal message pe kaho. 

Par aap unse kehte kya ho?
1. Aap Hitler ban rahe ho
2. Aap "Chaos" create kar rahe ho
3. Aapko policy banane kisne kahaa? Aap revenue road ka mudda solve karo.
4. Aap hote kaun ho XYZ kaam karne wale.
5. Aap builder ki bhasha bol rahe ho.

Agar yehi tareeka hai apne kisi bhi representative se baat karne ka, toh maaf kijiye, is kaam ke liye koi bhi sabhya insaan kabhi aage nahi aayega.

Kuchh aise hi comments aise logo se aaye hai jo hamare padosi hai. Kuchh hamare dost hai. Kuchh un logo ke Maa Baap hai jinke bachche hamare bachcho ke saath neeche khelte bhi honge.

Sochne wali baat yeh hai.

17/12/22, 11:42 pm - +91 99716 67972: Abhi RWA banni baaki h.. tab logo ko shayad samajh aaega ke policy ya kuch bhi ka implementation kaise hota h.. abhi to legal body na hone k vajah se kuch b bol rhe h log.. once the RWA comes into action and logo ko ansuna krenge tab logo ko pta chalega. Phr log bolenge ke aree rupali achi thi.. aree Arnie tanuj yahi log ache the and all. #futurepredictions
17/12/22, 11:43 pm - +91 99716 67972: By ansuna i meant ke implementation would be legalised with final versions
17/12/22, 11:43 pm - +91 99994 80107: I doubt any sane person in current scenario will nominate themselves
17/12/22, 11:44 pm - +91 99994 80107: Unless anyone who desperately wants to be in RWA
17/12/22, 11:44 pm - +91 99716 67972: Well
17/12/22, 11:46 pm - +91 98991 03291: This is v.sad, there was a meeting proposed to discuss the pressing issues. Then why wud u guys resign? Earlier RWA team also resigned the same way.. they were doing a good job too. Log kuch na kuch bolte hi rahenge! We all know that the members of d committee r taking out time n trying to get things done  Noone is paying them, they r working voluntarily. things don't happen overnight.. it takes time. Also not everyone will like all d rules n policies.. aap sabh ko kush nahin kar sakte! We all need to b patient n try n resolve things peacefully n not get into a whatsapp fight!
18/12/22, 1:15 am - +91 80108 90415: With great power comes great responsibility,  Learn from our PM Modi ji he is Pradhan sewak and works for the betterment of our country we need people like him in our rwa who would work for the betterment of MMV, let's not fight here what's wrong and what's right the situation got out of hand coz fmt posted it as parking policy but it was intended as a draft be cool and discuss what needs to be done going forward
18/12/22, 6:54 am - +91 77188 77606: Dear Executive Members , 

Constructive criticism, discussions are needed for efficient implementation of systems/ policies and should be welcomed . 
As a senior resident of the society, I can state that you all are working selflessly for betterment of the society. 
Our younger Residents have only highlighted the shortcomings of the parking policy and have made few suggestions which should be taken into consideration. 
Residents should be kept informed and taken along for all important matters such as information from builder on assets & liabilities , average monthly expenses on maintenance, security , horticulture, common area expenses, total parking slots , vendor management, revenue road , functioning of club etc etc ‚Ä¶.
This the not the time to resign but to  continue working with more vigours efforts. 
Request Gulshan ji, Chug saheb and Eshwaran Ji and others to continue working. Otherwise it would send wrong signals to the system for which we are fighting. 
As a senior resident, should I take liberty to state that your decision of resignation is not accepted and also rejected by Suresh Malik Ji . 
Kindly keep doing the good work and take along all residents. üôèüôè

18/12/22, 3:37 pm - +91 70301 19007: As far as I remember the issue of the residents was only with the way admin team was working not with the actual work they are doing. 

First they changed clubhouse timings from 11 to 10 without taking residents concerns. Mostly all of them were against.
Rules can't be imposed on residents by anyone let it be admin team or RWA. They needs to be discussed with residents before implementation.

Second admin team is making policies that is not in favour of residents and amount of fine will go to FMT pocket.
*Personally I am not against fine but as of now I am opposing this rule in policy as finances are not transparent with residents as finance is not in hand of admin team*
In any society policy is being made after discussion with residents not just copy paste like other societies are doing this so we will do same.
Every society has different factors/facilities.

So, Policies are important to be made but after discussion  rather than imposing directly.

Admin team should create a list of task with priority and work accordingly and everyone is aware criticism comes with the territory. 
Getting criticism is like hard pill to swallow, and giving it can often be harder. 

*It's my opinion only don't take anything personal.*üôè

RR team also faced the comments of Residence, builder or FMT. Challenges always there,  time also required , all spent time which can be use with family .
Some of 2 to 3 people did the resign from RR also due to personal reason.  But other Residence came forward to join the RR team. 

It's not comment or personel attack of residence that's only the suggest or view which make can make best living experience in society. 

My suggestion please continue with existing AC team . Just increase the connect with residence or keep regular meeting with him. üòÑüòÑüôè

As yesterday 1 residence mentioned he can help if some document can submit so I raised here 

In any case if I can help anything I will available.  It's for our family safety
18/12/22, 4:02 pm - +91 99997 57173: Correctly said
If you r part of advisory team so Criticism will be there by those who oppose a particular policy. 
If the policy is really good for society then come up strong points which really shows how beneficial the policy is. Rather than stating that other societies r following this policy is not a best reason for everyone to buy. We r already paying CAM charges why to pay extra for our guests coming why to fill fmt pockets with our money. 
After this again fmt will come with some policy n it will b told other societies r following this so this won‚Äôt end here.
Advisory team is made to keep our points n issues n policies in front of fmt rather than promoting their policies.
18/12/22, 4:04 pm - +91 95990 03600: With the agenda for the AGM a copy of the profit and loss account and audited balance sheet is circulated amongst all concerned. It is a legal requirement.
18/12/22, 4:07 pm - +91 72763 03938: Right. 


Strict rules in a family never helps. Aap apne bacho ko bhi strict rules se khush nhi kr skte or yha to 700+ families hai. Pyar se hi sab kaam ho jane hai yha, MMV me residents hi itne helpful hai.

18/12/22, 4:11 pm - +91 99998 21063: My suggestion 
Now please stop this topic all mature can be do it in simple way.

Request to all residence don't use abusive word when sending any messages in group. Any such message we consider it for all.

Else all choice we want to live  with  peace here.

18/12/22, 5:09 pm - +91 98737 20770: Agree, There should be no place for any kind of personal attacks and foul language in this group!!
At the same time I would request to our respected AC to re-look our current draft of parking policy and I think parking policy of spaze privy is quite balance policy and we can take some help of this policy to fine tune our draft.
Also I request our AC to instruct FMT to remove current draft from My Gate app to prevent any further rumors..
18/12/22, 5:11 pm - +91 89290 34569: Well, this one misses one point of residents abusing the parking area by drinking inside the car or outside. I have witnessed it and it makes sense to include the same with a heavy fine!

18/12/22, 8:40 pm - +91 89290 34569: Agreed Ankur. But given the fact that the AC was dissolved a few days back, one will have to figure out the POC.
18/12/22, 8:41 pm - +91 89290 34569: And this should be added to any parking policy that we are trying to replicate.

18/12/22, 9:23 pm - +91 89290 34569: This is exactly the reason why it doesn‚Äôt make sense for AC members to re think about their decision. Matron, girls hostel are juvenile words to describe a 750 member society.

Sir, did you see the policy shared by Puneet with 4-5 keys pointers? I am assuming you didn‚Äôt; hence the comment about charging for visitor parking without tangible knowledge. 

For your information and for everyone else, do read this excerpt from that parking policy.

19/12/22, 10:40 am - +91 99998 21063: My suggestion 
1. Security need FIR in police station on immediate basis.
2. If they're not doing, as MMV residence we need to raise FIR for the safety of ap. 1000 residence so 2 or 3 police people to be there 24x7 till we will not get the solution of revenue.

19/12/22, 2:53 pm - +91 99994 80107: I think untill whole dwarka express is completed this toll will stay
19/12/22, 2:58 pm - +91 99100 77054: Once the entire construction cost has been recovered there is ethically no justification for usage charges from traffic. This was contacted on BOT basis. NHAI can only operate if still part cost has not been recovered. State Govt has to pay that amount to NHAI to make it toll free.

19/12/22, 9:44 pm - +91 98100 26190: Let's know some unknown facts about Messi today

 Those who love football and keep regular updates on football must know Messi.
 Messi is the best footballer in the football world.  But we don't know everything about it.

 Messi earns 900 million euros at the end of the year.

 ‚úÖ Do you know?  48 percent of UNESCO's charitable trust's income comes from Messi's donations.

 Messi has single-handedly built 9847 schools in 189 countries.

 ‚úÖYou will be surprised to hear that he himself bears all the school expenses of 40 million children in the world.

 ‚úÖ You will be surprised to know that Messi alone bore the majority of the expenses of the Argentina team in the 2018 World Cup.

 ‚úÖMessi received millions of euros from Barca as a fee, but donated a large part to Barca's youth development project.  It is located in La Masia.  Messi himself grew up here.

 He helps 15 million street children of the world from his charitable trust.

 Argentina was the runner-up in the World Cup when Messi was there.  He donated the entire money of the runner-up to hospitals in Argentina.

 He is the one who said to Israel, I hate those who kill innocent children.

 Messi is one of the 50 donors in the world according to a Forbes survey.  ‚öΩüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

20/12/22, 4:14 pm - +91 99994 80107: Our society needs to tie up with any nearby hospitals! Wherein a nurse is available during day time for issues like BP monitoring, injection! First aid ! It's very common in other societies

If residents can volunteer a small First Aid Group with willing beneficiaries can be formed. This will reduce the fear feeling in such members. If possible a few Doctors with their consent can also be added.
20/12/22, 4:29 pm - +91 99994 80107: Btw this was happening in my previous society

Both the places are worth a visit as you would not have seen something like that before. Serene, beautiful and amazing view and the designing is so blissful. 

In some of my recent conversations with Pradeep, he is working relentlessly on safety and development of our area - such as streets lights for the road next to our society, CCTV at major points and so on. Felt very happy to see a Sarpanch with a vision and work ethics as well. üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè

20/12/22, 11:23 pm - +91 99110 32640: I preferred to clean my cars by myself instead of getting it cleaned by them
20/12/22, 11:50 pm - +91 70228 88847: Best way is to create a washing station within the basement, stp water can be used for cleaning cars, so a place needs to be identified where owner can take their car and using power jets cars can be cleaned in minutes
20/12/22, 11:51 pm - +91 70228 88847: All the hassle will, facility can be maintained by the residents and for the resident in non profit manner.

Tajmahal stands nowhere with regarding architecture, structure indepths when compared to other buildings e. g. Durgiana Temple of Mount Abu and so on,  as also mentioned in an Essay from official Text Book  for 10th class  in the year 1962 by Panjab University. Alas, it's all political game.

21/12/22, 12:59 pm - +91 98719 89782: Dear Residents 
Good afternoon

Spoken to Joint Commissioner of MCM today for property id camp in our society but they are facing manpower issue and They are unable to organised any camp so early. I have updated my name and phone number on last Friday and got it approved today and paid my outstanding tax. JC has promised that if we give them list of application they will approve this on top priority so that we all can pay property tax in time.

Let's meet in club house today at 9 pm if any one has any doubt on how to raise the objection so that we can make list of application and give MCM for urgent approval since without updating phone number you cant pay property tax.
Please dont forget to bring your laptop with you.

Regards
Dhirendra

 Written by Sudha Murthy,  wife of Narayan Murthy..
worth reading, plz dont miss it,  üëåüëåüëå it is simply mind blowing the way she explained ,in fact  a real eye opener for many of us . 

****she writes üëáüèª****

"When my daughter, the elder of my two, wed and left home, I felt a part of me gone.

With a daughter and a son, I know what both mean, differently.

When she was in her teens I felt as if she was my "physical extension" !

So when she left home to set up her own, I felt I lost a limb.

Next time she came to stay with us, I was astonished how her priorities had changed.

We too must've given the same shocks to our own parents !

When she said Amma,
she meant her mother-in-law, not me!

I felt she was always in a hurry to go back to her house and not stay with me for a few more days.

 That was the first time, it dawned on me that I have to start practising detachment with attachment.

Two years after my daughter‚Äôs marriage, my son left for higher studies to US.

Having experienced a child's separation once, I was better equipped emotionally.

I plunged head long into various classes held in the city starting from vedanta to healing to ikebana -
 I just wanted to be away from home..since my husband was a 24/7 workaholic.

My son used to write how he was missing my home cooked food, how he was waiting to come back to live in Chennai with us ...

After a few years, he did come back and we got him married.

He started living separately with his wife and we were also happy that they wanted to be independant from the beginning...

But now, it was all changed !

When in the U S, he missed my cooking, now if I called him to come over with his wife for a meal, it was always some excuse like "oh, amma, we have other plans for the day, please don't mistake us if we don't drop in today" !

I could see that his priorities had also changed completely..

We talk so many things and give so much advice to others, but when it comes to our own children, acceptance comes very late. 
Our next step is to just leave them undisturbed
in every way.

It was at that time, that I made the following, my 'new profile'.

*In all my relationships , rather interactions, I give my best and do my best to live up to what I say.*

My attachment with them is complete.

However, I remain detached in the sense that *I do not expect them to reciprocate my affection.*

Most importantly, I make a conscious effort , *not to interfere or pass judgements* on the lives they choose to lead.

My *concern for my near and dear ones will not fade with my detachment.*

If you let go of the ones you love, they will never go away ‚Äì
this is the *beauty of attachment with detachment !*

I have learnt to love and let go.

This dictum has developed tolerance in me.

When *I let the people live the* *way they want to, I learn to accept* *them for what they are.*

Most importantly ,
I learn to tolerate the world around me and this tolerance brings in me a sense of peace and contentment.

Now *I have realised that we start growing* *mentally much more only after the children leave the house* and we have to tackle the emotional vacuum, that arises, along with age-related problems .

I specially dedicate this post to my  friends, who are  totally  dependant  on their  children's lives, to nurture their  own  selves  emotionally.

Please develop your  own  intersts, hobbies  etc, however mundane they  seem to be..

We must learn
*To love whatever  we  do instead of doing whatever we love !!"*.

üçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄ

Very important to learn attachment with detachment with age.

22/12/22, 9:28 am - +91 70228 88847: Yeah it's ok
22/12/22, 9:32 am - +91 99721 67314: I spoke with Mapsko and they said registry is needed.. ü§î
22/12/22, 9:34 am - +91 70228 88847: BBA should be fine as property id is mandatory for registry

22/12/22, 9:37 am - +91 98103 02049: But does it not mean that the title is still in the name of Mapsko, till registry is done?
22/12/22, 9:40 am - +91 98719 89782: Only registry
22/12/22, 9:44 am - +91 99721 67314: Sorry, got confused! Registry is needed for correction in Property ID or Property ID is needed for Registry?
22/12/22, 9:48 am - +91 70228 88847: Both the statement made by you are true.
22/12/22, 9:49 am - +91 70228 88847: Looks like BBA will not work only registry will work.. sorry for the confusion
22/12/22, 9:50 am - +91 99998 80794: My registry was done jn March 2021 but still it is showing mapdko as an owner
22/12/22, 9:51 am - +91 70228 88847: Thumhara toh name change Kar diya hai mapsko ne.

22/12/22, 9:52 am - +91 99100 77054: Yes. For me old owner is someone else. A few flats were taken back in buyback scheme where buyer upgraded to bigger flat before registration. MAPSKO should have ensured the change in records
22/12/22, 10:03 am - +91 99721 67314: But I was told that it was a fresh unit and not a resale unit‚Ä¶
22/12/22, 10:05 am - +91 99100 77054: It is not resale as no registration was done. Only some allotment type.
22/12/22, 10:12 am - +91 99994 80107: If u have made the payments to builder then it's fresh unit for u

22/12/22, 11:23 am - +91 96507 19060: FYI - In addition to segregated actions required by the facility management team (FMT) and the occupants w.r.t. pre-and post-earthquake activities, few below mentioned varied points are also suggested to the FMT (marked up document posted below):
 
a)      Procedure should be tied-up with Fire Emergency Procedure for post-earthquake fire scenarios.
b)     To avoid confusion, it should be indicated who will be the Chief Coordinator - Property Management in the flowchart.
c)      Preferably, at least 2 persons (one more in addition to the Property Manager ‚Äì e.g., Asst. Property Manager or Fire Officer) should be designated who can activate the evacuation plan when the Property Manager is unavailable or not present at site to assess the situation.
d)     Lastly, a secondary/back-up Assembly Area/Point should also be identified (e.g., green area between commercial complex and sector road) to deal with emergencies wherein the primary Assembly Area itself gets impacted.
 
Scheduling an awareness session for the benefit of all the occupants of Mount Ville complex would be an ideal next step for emergency preparedness.

24/12/22, 2:11 pm - +91 84477 31434: We all should rethink, just because sake of sounding access card security system we may put ourselves in trouble, let the right infra in place first !
24/12/22, 2:11 pm - +91 84477 31434: Just a thought!
24/12/22, 2:13 pm - +91 99994 80107: Yeah correct! But should also not stop people from getting access cards from security! At least have it with you
24/12/22, 2:13 pm - +91 99994 80107: Boosters in basement is must need ! But we will anyway need access cards

24/12/22, 2:15 pm - +91 82917 66046: Infra in the basement has nothing to do with us collecting our cards. Let's do that at least. 
The issue in the basement is a problem majorly for those who park their cars there. 
Kids and senior citizens are largely unaffected by this since they rarely use basements alone.
24/12/22, 2:16 pm - +91 84477 31434: Lets see, however I still feel atleast phone network should be there ‚Ä¶and FYi they are locking doors now thats why I put the point there!
24/12/22, 2:16 pm - +91 82917 66046: Meanwhile some work is already happening on getting boosters in the basement. We just need to build pressure on FMT to get that done.

They have not deployed any dedicated staff for thousands of doors and sliders plus there is no respone to send a service guy would request to take this on priority if doors are not able to closed properly. Cool Breeze cmng continuously. 
Already raised issues with fmt multiple times but no action taken yet as usual.

Size - 30 by 24 inches

Medium - oil on canvas

Painting someone soaking up the sun in winter is an absolute pleasure. All the more delightful if it is one of ur loved¬†ones.¬†

Moms are the most beautiful beings inside out! No matter what age you are, you are always a child to your mother, the only person who never judges you and with whom you can get candid and lazy and still get pampered.

Thanks a ton mom for being patient and sitting throughout my live painting. Love u lots‚ô•

26/12/22, 4:20 pm - +91 99994 80107: Yeah
26/12/22, 4:21 pm - +91 88825 74968: Access cards are only for respective towers? We cant open doors of any other tower?
26/12/22, 4:21 pm - +91 88008 16147: Correct
26/12/22, 4:23 pm - +91 83174 97993: Just got them and it‚Äôs insane! If I were to go to anyone else‚Äôs place I have to take a MyGate approval apparently.
26/12/22, 4:24 pm - +91 88825 74968: Means no option to avoid heat of 47 degrees or wind of 2-3 degrees choosing basement for walk üôèüèº amazing
26/12/22, 4:25 pm - +91 83174 97993: Kids go for classes or if we have to just visit someone within the society toh bass MyGate pe daalte raho approve karte raho
26/12/22, 4:25 pm - +91 88825 74968: Each passing day i am regretting my decisions of past üòê about mapsko
26/12/22, 4:25 pm - +91 98719 89782: I think this is for our safety only but there are many flaws. One can access our flat without card through fire stairs
26/12/22, 4:26 pm - +91 83174 97993: Z plus security
26/12/22, 4:27 pm - +91 83174 97993: I think it‚Äôs not viable for residents. I agree there should be some security system but kids go to visit their friends, we have friends across towers so it seems like an hassle
26/12/22, 4:28 pm - +91 98719 89782: but they can visit through ground floor and this will be good for their safety.
26/12/22, 4:28 pm - +91 98719 89782: I know this is going to give us discomfort for all us but better for long run
26/12/22, 4:29 pm - +91 83174 97993: The FMT said everyone will need MyGate approval to visit towers other than our own
26/12/22, 4:29 pm - +91 95555 10105: Exactly than why we need this in first place? And there are 110% possibility it will not work most of the time ..if someone is coming with heavy stuff and door is not opening because of tech glitch what one will do ..i can guarantee, in frustration one will break it..kuch dino ka mehmaan hai ye
26/12/22, 4:30 pm - +91 98719 89782: Manish jee, I have seen few society where this is working perfectly fine and everyone is now used to it
26/12/22, 4:32 pm - +91 95995 57065: It takes time to get used to new things 
Change always brings discomfort in the beginning. It‚Äôll be fine in time‚Ä¶
26/12/22, 4:32 pm - +91 88027 71414: Sir, main gate automatic boom barrier they can't maintain, how can we trust this critical access point with them. Entry wala boom barrier is semi-functional now but entry has gone defunc 2days back.
26/12/22, 4:32 pm - +91 95555 10105: Even in DLF office building it doesn't work most of the time and the reason they put guard and sometime make it free..anyway its not going to solve the  purpose of security.
26/12/22, 4:33 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: I think access cards acceblity are very common in our offices also now a days . Offices also has emergency staircases they also have different buildings like in cybercity or horizon one and two and same things are applicable there also . Right from day one there also things are not 100% accurate and correct so in my opinion we should wait analyze and provide feedbacks to make our society the best one üôÇüëç
26/12/22, 4:33 pm - +91 99906 16200: It is a good step as it will tighten up security, and before this implementation guests were not asked where they were going at the ground floor reception,  they have started marking guest check in on mygate now.

It is very much needed.
26/12/22, 4:33 pm - +91 88027 71414: Access systems are critical to any building. If it is here to stay, let's ensure 1 guard is staffed to operate manually in case of emergency and technical glitchüôè
26/12/22, 4:34 pm - +91 88008 16147: And during the rainy days too
26/12/22, 4:34 pm - +91 95555 10105: they are going to ask the same with increase in CAM in few days ..wait and watch
26/12/22, 4:35 pm - +91 88027 71414: Non-intelligent implementation everwhere here in the name of smart systems
26/12/22, 4:35 pm - +91 83174 97993: I have always received guests after giving MyGate approval. My point is not wrt to people who come from outside, but possibly day to day minor things, for the residents ONLY
26/12/22, 4:36 pm - +91 88027 71414: Ussi ki toh tyaari hai yeh sab, few days only this will work, consider the overhead with residents
26/12/22, 4:36 pm - +91 99906 16200: Yes but if I am a resident of Tower F, I should need approval to enter any other tower.
26/12/22, 4:37 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: One question which resident go to other tower vai other basement Tower guards to hai hi na for normal entry and opening the doors simple
26/12/22, 4:38 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Tower entrance pr acces control hai lifts entry me nhi
26/12/22, 4:39 pm - +91 99716 67972: Iss tower k pass se exit staircase lo and then go from ground floor
26/12/22, 4:39 pm - +91 99716 67972: Seems like

26/12/22, 4:40 pm - +91 95555 10105: And best part is we dont have even camera installed at these fire exit staircase
26/12/22, 4:42 pm - +91 95555 10105: When I raised this with Mohit and FMT last week, they said it will increase the maintenance cost
26/12/22, 4:42 pm - +91 88825 74968: Bday surprise dene jao with approvals ü§£
26/12/22, 4:42 pm - +91 88825 74968: Everything is moving in that direction. In couple of months inn sabka hawala deke they are gng to increase cost anyways.

26/12/22, 4:44 pm - +91 99867 14748: And I don't see it being implemented in the club house. Where actually the entry should be restricted to residents only
26/12/22, 4:44 pm - +91 99994 80107: Guys mygate approval is anyway mandatory! People resist everything here ! Some are correlating access cards with network in basement
26/12/22, 4:44 pm - +91 99998 80794: Folks who are responding for morni car police complaint. If you wish to add your name please visit thana  with me. Your name snd signature will be required on the application
26/12/22, 4:46 pm - +91 99994 80107: I don't see anything new happening here with respect to access cards or mygate ! Yes some loose ends are there but they are everywhere
26/12/22, 4:48 pm - +91 95555 10105: nothing wrong in that. Just an example you forgot your card and you are in 2nd basement how you will get access? either you call someone with card which you cant as there is no network..so infra should be in place for any such implementation.
26/12/22, 4:49 pm - +91 99994 80107: Possibility of that is very less Manish ji
26/12/22, 4:49 pm - +91 99994 80107: U can simply come to gf and connect through gaurd
26/12/22, 4:50 pm - +91 95555 10105: And why cant we ask for network in basement ?
26/12/22, 4:50 pm - +91 99994 80107: Let's assume it can happen once in a month ! But that won't stop access cards
26/12/22, 4:51 pm - +91 99994 80107: Not saying we should not of course it's must to have
26/12/22, 4:51 pm - +91 99994 80107: But it shud not be like unless we don't have signal in basement! Let's not have access card
26/12/22, 4:52 pm - +91 95555 10105: That's everyone is saying have infra in place first and than implement these things
26/12/22, 4:52 pm - +91 99867 14748: Controlling access of visitors and others in the society is good, but restricting the residents within the society, that's an Oscar winning idea
26/12/22, 4:53 pm - +91 96505 64850: System i saw in the Security control room it has option to add access  to multiple towers just a check mark..For these kind of needs kids going in tuition/play together, regular visits, They should provide an option to add additional towers access on request basis atleast.
26/12/22, 4:53 pm - +91 98719 89782: Yehi to hai Mapsko ka ‡§´‡•Å‡§ü ‡§°‡§æ‡§≤‡•ã ‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã wala idea üí°
26/12/22, 4:53 pm - +91 98719 89782: üòÇ
26/12/22, 4:54 pm - +91 99994 80107: Yes that shud be done
26/12/22, 4:55 pm - +91 99867 14748: They will not add access to other towers in your cards, I tried
26/12/22, 4:57 pm - +91 96505 64850: Yeah but case can be made and it require no additional cost etc .. Maybe a point of discussion with FMT .
26/12/22, 4:59 pm - +91 98112 62620: Its for everyone‚Äôs security ‚Ä¶ though As neighbors slightly inconvenient 
But In the longer run we will understand and appreciate it
26/12/22, 4:59 pm - +91 98112 62620: üôè
26/12/22, 5:01 pm - +91 98112 62620: We should all first get access cards
Start with one tower access only
Do a pilot
And then get some learnings
And edit and improve
Step by step
Its an evolving world
26/12/22, 5:02 pm - +91 99117 15876: can we get access cards with soft copy of possession letter and id cards?
26/12/22, 5:02 pm - +91 99994 80107: Yes
26/12/22, 5:02 pm - +91 88008 16147: Yes
26/12/22, 5:03 pm - +91 98112 62620: There will be mutliple used cases
But my friend
Do we forget car keys
Or
Office keys
Or
Home keys
Its a similar thing
We all will get used to it and slowly become a habit
26/12/22, 5:03 pm - +91 98112 62620: Only soft copy
26/12/22, 5:04 pm - +91 99994 80107: I don't understand the resistance of not getting cards ! Let's keep the activation behind ! People are not taking them because there is no network üòÇ
26/12/22, 5:06 pm - +91 98112 62620: Access card is not a replacement to guards
It is an additional layer ‚Ä¶ for quick access or secured access
26/12/22, 5:06 pm - +91 99994 80107: Keeping the situation when u have network but don't have access card ? Isn't that inconvenience for the person who has to come down to rescue open gate for you
26/12/22, 5:09 pm - +91 95555 10105: exactly when you forgot car key you have option to go and get that..but here you cant go and cant even ask someone to help..think about elderly..I can go 2 floors what about them..what are we in such hurry to implement this..10-15 dino mai kuch nahi ho jaayega pahle baaki ka kaam to pura karo..everyone wants security
26/12/22, 5:09 pm - +91 88027 71414: Exactly, my concern is with FMT/Mapsko with their reputation of handling technology systems, be it Aaru app, Capital meters EB vs DG, Boom barriers at entry/exit. This system goes defunc and someone is in an emergency and trapped
26/12/22, 5:10 pm - +91 99994 80107: Let's find out whose scope booster are FMT or between providers
26/12/22, 5:13 pm - +91 98112 62620: I understand emergency view point üôè
And possibly booster is a good idea ‚Ä¶

But i have stayed in 3 different societies in Gurgaon 
All have basements
None have mobile network
None have installed boosters
People have never complained 
Life goes on ‚Ä¶
No intention to hurt anyone‚Äôs feeling just sharing perspective
26/12/22, 5:14 pm - +91 98112 62620: And i have had ailing parents requiring medical assistance on regular basis
26/12/22, 5:14 pm - +91 98975 20593: Fmt have some genius experts with them abhi exit gate ka boom barrier theek hua hai n entry ka same time pe kharaab
26/12/22, 5:15 pm - +91 99994 80107: Galti se mistake hogaya ! Short circuit kar diya
26/12/22, 5:17 pm - +91 98975 20593: Aisi galti kaafi common hai fmt walo k liye

Don't know the reason/s for deactivation. So far as increase in CAE charges, as someone put it as a prelude, i don't 5hink it.matters. if we can pay 5 times the normal charges for electricity we can afford this too. What's surprising is that we have our views on everything but not on good potable water which in my opinion should be the priority alongwith the regular electricity connection

27/12/22, 1:07 pm - +91 98361 34428: Hi so the staircase that opens outside the tower doesn't have inside access to the lobby.
And the ones that open into the lobby don't have basement access. If anything this is a cause of concern during an emergency.

27/12/22, 1:22 pm - +91 97113 38008: Agreed
My point is that how does card enabled entry help if any outsider can easily come from an emergency staircase 

Usually emergency staircases gates have push handles from inside so that nobody can open from outside but here anyone can access

28/12/22, 9:13 am - +91 88027 71414: True, some more issues like meter ports being used for a purpose not meant.
28/12/22, 9:13 am - +91 99994 80107: There is device available in market and operational in many societies where u get to know accurate reading live ! It displays if DG or EB is On
28/12/22, 9:13 am - +91 99994 80107: But have heard that device is not compatible with our meters
28/12/22, 9:14 am - +91 88027 71414: Though at times, Aaru app shows correct DG vs EB status.

28/12/22, 9:30 am - +91 99100 77054: Almost always lagging. By the time DG is on it shows 30 minutes or so old status.üòÑ
28/12/22, 9:32 am - +91 99100 77054: The prepaid meter in all power backup societies has indicator to show status. This APP based information is tedious. Open App to know status every now and then is not done.

Non scene decision.
Card leke ghumte raho ab.
Kafi wahiyat decision hai jiska bhi hai.
Har floor pe bhi lagwado.koi gwandi na ajaye galti se security bhang karne.

Itane stringent ho to card bhi ghar pahunchado.
28/12/22, 12:45 pm - +91 97174 52094: *sense

28/12/22, 12:54 pm - +91 95609 96032: Dear Mr. Dhirendra Ji,

Kindly note that I had filled all the desired details in the shared Google sheet. However, in my case the approval is still pending at MC Level 2. In case this approval process can be expedited then I will be able to pay my property tax before the last date of 31st December, 2022. Thanking each & every person who extended his kind cooperation thereby enabling me to achieve this milestone. 

Thanks & warm regards,

28/12/22, 1:00 pm - +91 97174 52094: This is serious. We have kids n senior citizens in the society.we must keep des points in mind before anyone propose such stupid ideas üí°
28/12/22, 1:04 pm - +91 99487 08800: If with so many security guards, security is still a concern, this concern can never be resolved.  Bachhon ko bhi khelne jaana hai to card leke jayenge and then ofcourse they are kids only and bound to forget it somewhere, in that case too, somebody else might use their lost card.  There can be multiple situations.  To top it all JLL is doing an excellent job in making things more complex.
28/12/22, 1:04 pm - +91 88008 16147: Guys, MCG portal is down right now. The approval team is waiting for the website to get up and running. It would take more time to get the approvals.

I think lesson learnt .. don‚Äôt keep the door closed when your kids are alone

And secondly to keep the keys at a place somewhere outside the bedrooms

29/12/22, 9:19 pm - +91 99487 08800: I personally don't agree, it's our home not any 5 star hotels or High Security Area like office buildings etc.  It will create unnecessary mess for kids, senior citizens as well as for residents.  Nobody is entering from the main gate without entering their details, that is somewhere where in case we want to put in more security measures we should put it.  However, its my take only.  And anyways systems are already in place, now its just dealing with JLL, going through unnecessary documentation which are already done multiple times with them, and then making sure somebody is there along with kids and elders all the time, specially if they are going to LB and UB.

May we all get the time to enjoy our good times and ‚Äúplace our orders in time‚Äù for everything we wish for and there is always ‚Äúlimited stock available‚Äù for the time we have on this earth. Let‚Äôs cherish each moment of this new year and be togetherü§ó

01/01/23, 10:40 pm - +91 96507 19060: Dear All,

The last year saw some progress in making fire protection system (smoke detectors & sprinklers) operational in common areas including club house, lift lobbies, banquet hall and its kitchen, fixing issues with fire exit doors of all the towers and putting revised Emergency Procedure (Earthquake) in place (Tickets ‚Äì 2925, 2926, 5674, 7386, 9124, 14918, 16172, 16257, 16267, 16279, 16921, 16974, 17942, 19049). The Fire Emergency procedure, however, is yet to be made ready (Ticket 22820). The smoke detectors in some flats might probably not be fully available yet and owners should liaise with FMT to address them. Additionally, action is also pending on the Ticket 17018 (posted below) to ensure an easy access and exit to the fire brigade and to provide it easy access to the Draw-in and Draw-out connections.

Hope this year strengthens fire & safety elements even further.

*FIRE BRIGADE DRILL*
The FMT‚Äôs update on the deferred action of Fire Brigade drill (Ticket 16682 posted below) is that it would cost around ‚Çπ12,000/- for small fire tender and ‚Çπ21,000/- for big fire tender. The drill with Fire Brigade is a best practice adopted by facilities but given our prevailing situation when the *Exit gate near Tower-A is unavailable and Draw-in and Draw-out connections meant for the Fire Brigade are inaccessible*, the fire brigade drill seems to be a pressing need to check if our complex can receive external firefighting support effectively. It‚Äôs up to us now if we want to pursue conducting this drill and discussing it with FMT but, in my opinion, the drill charges should not be passed on to the residents as they are not responsible for the abovementioned situation our complex has been subjected to for more than a year.

Wish you all a very happy, healthy, safe, and peaceful new year!

02/01/23, 2:57 pm - +91 88825 74968: I have been part of earlier meetings regarding DG sets with Ramesh and Mohit and they were adamant that we will switch on DG but any fine if imposed residents need to pay . In these terms who will agree with them?
02/01/23, 2:57 pm - +91 95607 77552: Yaha situation hath se ja rhi

02/01/23, 2:59 pm - +91 99994 80107: Well they have a point regarding fine ! But then other societies are also taking this risk
02/01/23, 3:00 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV: Irrelevant

02/01/23, 3:03 pm - +91 88007 62986: But we do not have a team in place who can take this up! The committee is dissolved

02/01/23, 3:04 pm - +91 99963 76383: i believe people switch to society for better life and amenities which we get‚Ä¶seems here we are living in village still where we are actually paying maintenance to suffer this kind of problem,,,,power backup is the first thing which people see when they come in society
02/01/23, 3:05 pm - +91 99963 76383: never saw this kind of stuff anywhere else
02/01/23, 3:05 pm - +91 88007 62986: True
02/01/23, 3:05 pm - +91 88007 62986: The day we all stand united things will change drastically
02/01/23, 3:06 pm - +91 99994 80107: And that day is unfortunately very far seeing current scenario
02/01/23, 3:07 pm - +91 88007 62986: Handful of people are opposing the bad practices with not even 50% of the strength backing them up
02/01/23, 3:09 pm - +91 99963 76383: most of the people in our society has work from home and different office timings as well.. we cannot afford 4-5 hours of no power on regular basis,,,definitely we need to oppose this until some solution is permanently finalized
02/01/23, 3:10 pm - +91 99994 80107: Just a general questions since I have work from office how often we get this long breakdown?

It's high time for AO and residents to push forward for proper electrical infrastructure and back up for which we have paid separately

We cant keep sitting without electricity indefinitely
02/01/23, 3:19 pm - +91 99963 76383: i also believe that meeting should be on satuday or sunday so that maximum strength participate
02/01/23, 3:28 pm - Saurabh Dawar MMV: We should get solar panels in place. Even if it means paying extra right now. In long run it will be much better

02/01/23, 7:09 pm - +91 95607 77552: Hello guys .. few of us went to FMT office today and had few discussions with Ramesh Malik and FMT

We need to have a meeting with builder /FMT asap as things are getting out of hand and our AO has to step in they suggested 

Few imp points discussed today: 
1. FMT have only one answer for every question that they are following govt rules and who will bear the penalty if we use DG
2. They said that some meeting happened with residents earlier and it was agreed that DG will not be used .. none of us were aware of such meetings and we wanted to know who were these residents who agreed with FMT on non usage of DG.. did this meeting happen or FMT was just saying like that to avoid our questions
2.  We raised many important points like
a) we have in our contract 1lakh taken for providing power back up , now it‚Äôs Mapsko responsibility to abide by that.. either they use DG or they convert their DGs into green anything.. 
b) all the other societies are actually using the DG or providing power back up , then why it‚Äôs only Mapsko who is following these type of rules .. they should check how the other societies are working and providing DG and provide us the same way 
c) we paid so much to live in this society then why we are not getting power back up
d) in case of power failure from source they should provide DG still they are not using it 
e) they mentioned a very important point that they are working on changing their DGs into green one oil one for which 6 months will be taken .. can they ensure this in notice and provide in writing like how they used to provide very notice
02/01/23, 7:10 pm - +91 95607 77552: So the outcome or concern is what happens next

They have told that we ask Suresh Malik to strong put this point and ask for solutions 

@919818250395 ji can you please put this power back up point on priority and put residents concern and demands to FMT and builder and get a solution on these as earliest as possible
02/01/23, 7:13 pm - +91 95607 77552: Also we all residents need to have a meeting on this topic and get our concerns registered.. 
we can have power back up on DG for Few hours every day, all the society is having similar functionality 
And DG sets converted into green ones in 6 months to have a permanent solution
02/01/23, 7:18 pm - +91 95607 77552: Also Anyone else who was there in FMT office today can add a point If I missed anything important ..
02/01/23, 7:23 pm - +91 94161 22325: üëåüëåabsolutely right üëçüëç
02/01/23, 7:26 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Sir you are also invited ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüê†
02/01/23, 7:50 pm - +91 99994 80107: Any recommendations for air fryer
02/01/23, 7:50 pm - +91 99994 80107: Anyone using Philips or inalsa
02/01/23, 7:52 pm - +91 95995 57065: Philips is good
02/01/23, 7:52 pm - +91 70427 50700: Philips is good üëç
02/01/23, 7:58 pm - +91 91795 78177: I am using Philips from last 7 yrs. It is too good.
02/01/23, 7:59 pm - +91 99994 80107: Thanks
02/01/23, 8:20 pm - +91 88823 87521: Rightly stated sneha. FMT has read circular in black and white without considering implementation challenges and problems to residents.

Today's situation can be encountered in future also. Need a permanent solution for this. This one is not the only winter we will be spending. Grap is gonna stay and we need permanent solution

There should be a proper sop for implementing grap instead of vague statement by FMT saying they are following guidelines and cant provide power.üòè

Today didn't seemed as an end to this problem.
02/01/23, 8:22 pm - +91 95297 41496: Does the FMT office get power backup?
02/01/23, 8:22 pm - +91 88823 87521: Yes
02/01/23, 8:22 pm - +91 95297 41496: Explains why they don‚Äôt give a shit
02/01/23, 8:23 pm - +91 88823 87521: When we reached FMT office they were having power.
02/01/23, 8:23 pm - +91 95297 41496: This message was deleted
02/01/23, 8:23 pm - +91 88823 87521: And there was no light in hallway. I had an amazon delivery and had to open gate in pitch black. It was scary.

02/01/23, 8:26 pm - +91 99994 80107: And if society gets fined are residents ok to equally contribute in fine
02/01/23, 8:26 pm - +91 99994 80107: As other societies have given assurance to FMT regarding fine
02/01/23, 8:26 pm - +91 95297 41496: This message was deleted
02/01/23, 8:27 pm - +91 99994 80107: Exactly
02/01/23, 8:29 pm - +91 99994 80107: As per builder the 11 KVa formalities are similar to 33 kva like bg and all... however today it seems to be breakdown from backend
02/01/23, 8:31 pm - +91 95297 41496: This message was deleted
02/01/23, 8:33 pm - +91 99994 80107: True lets just end it üòÖ even if it's 10000 won't be more than 25 rs per house ! And our residents who are working from home are suffering so lets fix it
02/01/23, 8:43 pm - +91 98734 89806: I believe it's few hundreds but per sq. feet multipy to the total sq. feet area we have and that amount will be enourmous
02/01/23, 8:43 pm - +91 99994 80107: Sorry i take my resolution back üòÖ
02/01/23, 8:44 pm - +91 99994 80107: This message was deleted

02/01/23, 8:45 pm - +91 99994 80107: Done
02/01/23, 8:45 pm - +91 98734 89806: It's not even required if FMT & residents stand together, but for that FMT should take a stand for residents
02/01/23, 8:46 pm - +91 99994 80107: How do u fix the situation when they say we are going as per norm ! Which is in principle correct
02/01/23, 8:46 pm - +91 99994 80107: So we are kind of Stuck
02/01/23, 8:48 pm - +91 98734 89806: It's with the special kinda nego skill but difficult to use them here üòÖ coz we don't know who's talking to who and when etc etc....
02/01/23, 8:49 pm - +91 99117 15876: why don't we push to expedite DG conversion to PNG, that will solve the issue for long term
02/01/23, 8:49 pm - +91 99994 80107: Yes true ! It's the best solution for long term
02/01/23, 8:51 pm - +91 99117 15876: <Media omitted>

02/01/23, 8:52 pm - +91 88005 87720: Rightly said‚Ä¶
I think we all should stand together in this as it hampers all directly‚Ä¶And there should not be any reading within the lines‚Ä¶
02/01/23, 8:52 pm - +91 95607 77552: So true .. they are referring their circulars only and not reading/referring any one of our articles or points ..
Builder is non compliant because they don‚Äôt have appropriate DG set up green one and residents are suffering ..
02/01/23, 8:53 pm - +91 98710 56080: <Media omitted>
02/01/23, 8:54 pm - +91 88005 87720: I think it‚Äôs an old video

02/01/23, 8:58 pm - +91 95297 41496: Our district is Manesar right? And we are under MCM now instead of MCG?
02/01/23, 8:59 pm - +91 99831 01666: That‚Äôs correct
02/01/23, 9:01 pm - +91 99906 16200: Manesar town itself is under Gurugram district 
And our area comes under Manesar municipality
02/01/23, 9:20 pm - Harsh Sharma MMV: Very old video

02/01/23, 9:46 pm - +91 98182 50395: I discussed the present problem with Mohit Single who is out of station since last 10 days and may come on 7 the Jan.
 I advised him to place the order to FMT immediately to start the DG set at that time and assured him to handle the all sequence if comes,
Do not worry ,we will all handle the situation,
02/01/23, 9:53 pm - +91 98975 20593: Can you also please help in speeding up the process of conversation of dg sets to green fuel so that we can resolve this issue permanently
02/01/23, 10:10 pm - +91 97180 20007: "https://www.fueladream.com/home/campaign/58744

My son *KRISHIV SALUJA* is running a crowdfunding campaign to *transform the lives of govt school students in Delhi and UP by providing them with mid-day meals.* Classroom hunger affects children‚Äôs ability to learn and grow. This campaign aims to solve this problem through the Akshaya Patra 'Food for Education' initiative.

The Mid-Day meal serves as an incentive for children to get proper education, eliminates malnutrition, and helps them get better grades. By feeding them one wholesome meal a day, students get the nourishment and motivation they need to pursue an education for a better future.

Just *INR 1500* will provide mid day meals to *a child for an entire year (232 days).* For example, if you fund *INR 4500*, you impact *three children for a year.* This is being done in partnership with the *Akshaya Patra Foundation.*

Please support this campaign by clicking on the link above and donate with a *Credit/Debit card, wallets, Net-banking, UPI etc. This campaign has 80G tax benefits.* You will also get feedback on how the funds were used and which school you have impacted."

02/01/23, 11:06 pm - +91 99117 15876: This will be a persistent long term solution. @919818250395 hope you are looking into this too.
02/01/23, 11:28 pm - +91 99716 67972: We can't push the builder to turn on DG because one- who will bear the cost and second is they are following govt rules technically. So conversion of DG sets to green fuel is more sound option and we should push for that.
02/01/23, 11:38 pm - +91 98111 73300: Not been following this discussion. But is this norm restricted to MMV, there are multiple other societies(some newer than MMV) but they are running DG during power cuts.
02/01/23, 11:40 pm - +91 99716 67972: Well If someone is not abiding the rules then it doesn't mean that our society will also face the same
02/01/23, 11:40 pm - +91 99716 67972: I feel it can be timed outage till we get long term solution
02/01/23, 11:53 pm - +91 95400 96333: This is what I proposed ‚Ä¶ but then there are gods who don‚Äôt understand that ‚Ä¶ and of course some autocrats who have cursed the society ‚Ä¶. By not going green ‚Ä¶. IGL is ready to help us ‚Ä¶ I have spoken to them ‚Ä¶ but we are swinging between developer and residents ‚Ä¶ I am ready ‚Ä¶ can we come to conclusion that we have a CNG powered electric supply ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt mind paying for it ‚Ä¶ it would be end of problem for ever ‚Ä¶ IGL is ready to help us technically and politically ‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt we ask for a techno - commercial quote from them for implementation of this swich over to IGL
03/01/23, 12:03 am - +91 99998 21063: Tentative cost 27 L to  35 L .
Average cost per Flat Rs 4000

Additional we can't claim for warranty of engine whic need to discuss. 

Builder purchased the DG recently he know abt GRAP rule so why he purchased the diesel generator
03/01/23, 12:47 am - Harsh Sharma MMV: My single question today when few people went to FMT then actions were .
Why not in advance. 
Lots of solution is possible but zero implementation. 
Everything favours  Builder  and FMT .
Fmt office  light is coonected with basements and basements  lights  comes in essentials. 
Then what floor lobbies and tower lobbies .
Somebody has booked theatre and no light then what dg will run..
Lot of aspects has to be taken care .
Would request TO RAISE ISSUES WITH BUILDER WERE THEY FINANCE AND SOLUTIONS CAN BE DONE. Till the time RWA Comes

04/01/23, 6:25 pm - +91 98188 20212: Company is, our area is not. I had a conversation with Vaibhav, our security is a big culprit here too, they sent a team of 25 people a few days back so that they can atleast clean the cars from outside, but within 15 mins goons came and broke thier car. And this happened when they came to MMV after finishing from both Aria and 101
04/01/23, 6:27 pm - +91 98119 83017: How did they get to know?
04/01/23, 6:28 pm - +91 72763 03938: Through guards
04/01/23, 6:28 pm - +91 98188 20212: Someone from the security or admin

04/01/23, 6:31 pm - +91 98188 20212: I am not sure what local issue is, as far as morning cars is concerned, they take money from customers and offer services, they have operations running smoothly all over Gurgaon but just not this area,
04/01/23, 6:31 pm - +91 98119 83017: Do you have names?
04/01/23, 6:33 pm - +91 98188 20212: I don't have details, he just told me thier cars was broken and within 15-20 mins of them entering the premises, a 15-20 people came,

04/01/23, 6:48 pm - +91 99908 90947: He told the same story to me as well‚Ä¶
While they were cleaning cars inside our society ‚Ä¶ someone gave them insider info about their cleaners and some goons came and trashed their car which was standing outside the MMV.
04/01/23, 6:50 pm - +91 99908 90947: They are able to run operations smoothly at other societies in Gurgoan but whenever they start operations in MMV someone beats their cleaner or some brawl keep on happening ‚Ä¶

05/01/23, 3:50 pm - +91 98115 01899: Is everyone facing this issue
05/01/23, 3:55 pm - +91 96505 64850: We should not be paying garbage tax as it's not picked up by municipality, right?
05/01/23, 4:01 pm - +91 99994 80107: Yes and paid as well

Again this notice has come
So we are again back to the discussion where we started with FMT

Can you please look into this .. our concerns remains the same .. which we earlier stated
07/01/23, 11:06 am - +91 88823 87521: Hi sir @919818250395  Please help us what discussion is going on with builder on this.

Mr ramesh said builder will return from vacation by 5th. Can we get a meeting to understand next steps. 

He also said that they are doing some work to get emission controlled generator and that might take some 6 months. We asked him to give in writing to which he denied as he himself isnt confident... its very easy to publish in notice make your own arrangements.

When we came in society they promised 24√ó7 power backup. This is not acceptable
07/01/23, 11:07 am - +91 95607 77552: and they did not tell us also what is the plan of action for 6 months till the time green DG is set up
07/01/23, 11:08 am - +91 95607 77552: Or what is the plan how back up will be provided to us in these 6 months
07/01/23, 11:14 am - +91 88823 87521: If there is a power outage from source more than a hour due to repair work/breakdown. We must get backup. 

Many of us have work from home. We cant work without power. This is taken as a joke by FMT. While all of us were sitting without power. Their office was having continuous power supply.

Their work comes under essential service

07/01/23, 3:02 pm - +91 78385 95814: I mean if we can install inverter then problem can get solved
07/01/23, 3:09 pm - +91 95990 03600: Nothing gets solved even with inverter. I have inverter but do I get any warmath with it. Atleast those who are in dire need of heating system need to do introspection by the authorities.
07/01/23, 3:12 pm - +91 99117 15876: yea, you can't use heaters with inverters
07/01/23, 3:14 pm - +91 95990 03600: And the heating system is my life line. Anyways jiska koi nahi khuda to hai yaro'

07/01/23, 3:42 pm - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: It was agreed last time dg will be on again no idea why this is not being doneüò≥
07/01/23, 3:42 pm - +91 96505 64850: .Baaki sab to chalega but electricity is very basic thing..if JLL can't solve this they are good for nothing..
07/01/23, 3:43 pm - +91 98975 20593: FMT office me light aa rhi hogi to JLL ko koi problem kyu hogi
07/01/23, 3:43 pm - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: It's builder more than JLL who is calling the shots
07/01/23, 3:45 pm - +91 98118 81674: We have been hearing that for a year and more now. Are we really so helpless that we can‚Äôt influence anything where we live?

07/01/23, 3:47 pm - +91 98118 81674: @919818250395 Sir the frequency of power cuts is unbearable. Agar iss situation mein bhi ye DG nahi chala sakte to aap bataiye yeh society kaise manage hone waali hai?
07/01/23, 3:47 pm - +91 98118 81674: Kya discussion ho raha hai FMT se? Kyun koi resolution nahi hai iska?
07/01/23, 3:48 pm - +91 88823 87521: As per Ramesh malik's logic. Today is weekend. Logo ko fark ni padta.

That's what he said last time as per his adsumption
07/01/23, 3:50 pm - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: FMT wants to safeguard itself from potential penalty and hence not switching on. Let all residents tell him and give him.signed memorandum. Anyway all penalities are being paid by us through CAM..
07/01/23, 3:51 pm - +91 98118 81674: That penalty will be on top of what we pay from CAM
07/01/23, 3:51 pm - +91 96505 64850: We have 100s societies is Gurgaon nowhere anyone is asking memorandum..
07/01/23, 3:51 pm - +91 88823 87521: Builder have to arrange backup. Hum kyu suffer kare. Its not our fault builder has instated diesel generators.
07/01/23, 3:52 pm - +91 72763 03938: Is there any society you know who paid penalty??
07/01/23, 3:52 pm - +91 88823 87521: Anyways money has been taken from us at the time of purchase for providing backup
07/01/23, 3:52 pm - +91 95400 96333: Ladies and Gentlemen the only way is to protest ‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs join together tomorrow at 12 noon to stop everyone from operating from Sales office Mapsko and JLL office being closed ‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt need them when we pay for their salaries and they make our lives miserable‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs get rid of them
07/01/23, 3:52 pm - +91 88823 87521: Abhi kyu nahi?
07/01/23, 3:53 pm - +91 99831 01666: I happened to be in the corporate office today and got to meet Mr. Ajay Malik. The crux is, ‚Äúother builders are taking the ownership in case any legal action/penalties are being imposed on other societies. Mapsko owners (builder not the residents) are not taking that responsibility.‚Äù Hence FMT will not be able to help. 
As for the long term solution of moving to gas based gensets that looks a distant dream in my opinion.
07/01/23, 3:53 pm - +91 98118 81674: @919818250395 Sir iska samadhaan kariye aapse request hai üôèüèºüôèüèº People will keep suffering and humen koi solution nahi nazar aa raha. Only you can help üôèüèºüôèüèº
07/01/23, 3:53 pm - +91 95400 96333: Let‚Äôs give them 24 hrs to mend their ways
07/01/23, 3:54 pm - +91 88823 87521: Sir. Us din bhi we stood there wasted 3-4 hours of our time for getting backup started. That was a working day. Now since everyone has time today, lets protest today
07/01/23, 3:54 pm - +91 95990 03600: And the government won't allow diesel generators for power backup. Needs government intervention.
07/01/23, 3:54 pm - +91 99831 01666: They might switch on the DG ain terms of longer power cuts, but is also not a given thing
07/01/23, 3:54 pm - +91 88823 87521: They have already released circular stating make your own arrangements
07/01/23, 3:57 pm - +91 96505 64850: First of all on legality, DHVN is also responsible for providing electricity i am sure on paper they are providing 24 hour . They don't accept that they have power cuts regular & it's all corrupted departments and someone fault in timely not maintaining infra is the root cause of power cut. So i don't think they ever impose fine on power cut backup.. It's only who have not taken connection and running DG as primary source.. Only those societies were targeted..
07/01/23, 3:58 pm - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: Exactly Durgesh...
07/01/23, 3:59 pm - +91 95400 96333: Then why we are being punished
07/01/23, 3:59 pm - +91 95400 96333: Whose dictat
07/01/23, 4:00 pm - +91 96505 64850: It's all Builders and JLL doing. No society is stopping DG on power cut.. not even for single day..
07/01/23, 4:00 pm - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: Power is back
07/01/23, 4:01 pm - +91 81465 10899: Basically GRAP orders are fir under construction Facilities
07/01/23, 4:01 pm - +91 81465 10899: For*
07/01/23, 4:02 pm - +91 98182 50395: After long discussion,they will starting DG, please have a patience,
07/01/23, 4:03 pm - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: Power is back sir
07/01/23, 4:03 pm - +91 95400 96333: Who is the singular person responsible for that ‚Ä¶. Can‚Äôt we name him or her and remove him or her from system‚Ä¶. There are old age parents ‚Ä¶ infants and many more vulnerable people ‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt we be ‚ÄúHuman‚Äù ‚Ä¶ even if there is a green cost penalty for agriculture people burning subtle in Punjab and we paying for this in NCR ‚Ä¶ have a heart
07/01/23, 4:03 pm - +91 98118 81674: Sir patience bahut hai and aap par bharosa bhi hai. Please inko boliye jab tak ye resolve nahi ho raha chupchap DG apne aap chala den bina logon ko pareshan kiye üôèüèº
07/01/23, 4:04 pm - +91 98118 81674: Power aati jaati rahegi uncle. Issue ka resolution kya hai wo nahi ho raha.
07/01/23, 4:04 pm - +91 98118 81674: Builder used to come on Thursdays. Aana band hai?
07/01/23, 4:05 pm - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: Agree. Builder was on new year holiday
07/01/23, 4:06 pm - +91 96505 64850: Yes and somehow if they do these shenanigans and verbiage on memorandum. We can come on road for protests and we can also find lots of other points , Fir wo Sale kar lenge..
07/01/23, 4:06 pm - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: All decision are made by Mohit only. Others Ramesh if JLL and Ajay of Essence no power
07/01/23, 4:06 pm - +91 95400 96333: The only way is to stop their Sales office at Mapsko and stop all prospective buyer ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs do it at 12 noon
07/01/23, 4:07 pm - +91 96505 64850: Yes.. @919818250395 please communicate to them that's the last resort we have . If they don't hear you , we will plan protest tomorrow...
07/01/23, 4:08 pm - +91 95990 03600: Why doesn't someone approach CAQM enumerating the difficulties. That's the right way to get things done. Neither JLL nor builder is competent to get away from GRAP unless the builder instals a clean fuel system.
07/01/23, 4:09 pm - +91 98103 02049: Sir, we need to have a permanent fix to this issue....we need to have clear guidelines to FMT by Builder+US
viz...During Grap order, DG must run(as cited by residents)...in case any penalty...either Builder manages with authorities, alternatively, residents to agree to bear.

Non clarity to operating team, in this case FMT is causing this..
07/01/23, 4:09 pm - +91 98182 50395: Mohit ji, ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á, ‡§∏‡•Å‡§¨‡§π ‡§∏‡•á ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó ‡§ö‡§ø‡§≤‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç, ‡§ó‡•Å‡§°‡§º‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ç‡§µ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•ã‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ö‡§≤ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç, ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã

07/01/23, 4:11 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Solar pannel installation on rooftop can also be alternative solution as every tower terrace hse sufficient space for its installation ‚úÖ
07/01/23, 4:11 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: And we use renewable source of energy
07/01/23, 4:12 pm - +91 98103 02049: Do we have connects, who can study and give proposal?
07/01/23, 4:13 pm - +91 99994 80107: Guys understand JLL has nothing to with this they are simply following builders commands who is their client
07/01/23, 4:14 pm - +91 96505 64850: They are on fault as they do maintainence of 10 others societies atleast in Gurgaon and nowhere this grap nonsense they are following

07/01/23, 4:20 pm - +91 95400 96333: Why don‚Äôt we have a resident open meeting to discuss all these issues ‚Ä¶ we have no option to protest ‚Ä¶ yes We have to protest against Mapsko builders for cheating us ‚Ä¶ but JLL has to be pro residents ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs all meet together and take forward ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs protest and close Mapsko sales office and also JLL office ‚Ä¶.

1. Issue due to Grap..to be addressed.
2. Planned DGs are Diesel run, as per trends....how to get converted....cost and timeline?
07/01/23, 4:30 pm - +91 95400 96333: It‚Äôs for the benefit for everyone in the society ‚Ä¶. Sometimes you have to stand up
07/01/23, 4:32 pm - +91 98737 20770: Pls confirm who all are available for tomorrow..
07/01/23, 4:34 pm - +91 98737 20770: Actually it‚Äôs high time now,
07/01/23, 4:34 pm - +91 99998 21063: Tanuj ji
Builder purchased the DG in 2020 or 1 nos DG last year . That time also GRAP rule is same so why he purchased the Diesel operated Generator instead of PNG Gas based . 

If he did the wrong section of Generator so why MMV residence pay for the conversion of PNG
07/01/23, 4:35 pm - +91 96505 64850: ‚úã , Let's get confirmation from our AO sir @919818250395 , if they don't agree with him in providing backup..Let's plan big protest & some symbolic Locking of the FMT office..
07/01/23, 4:35 pm - +91 95297 41496: Good idea
07/01/23, 4:36 pm - +91 98103 02049: That he needs to answer
07/01/23, 4:39 pm - +91 99998 21063: Right so everyone thinking for betterment 
we all need to push builder to install the correct specification of DG
Either AO can raise or together residence can raise concern
07/01/23, 4:40 pm - +91 72763 03938: It will be great if we all can agree on a point either it will be between a group of people or all residents meeting.
07/01/23, 4:42 pm - +91 95400 96333: Let‚Äôs all ladies and children meet and express our protest at 12 noon ‚Ä¶ I propose the youngest above 18 would be the leader ‚Ä¶ similarly in the all resident meeting the youngest above 21 would be our Chairman ‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs all meet and grow together ‚Ä¶ we are the beautiful MMV family
07/01/23, 4:43 pm - +91 99998 21063: It's for benefits for all residence live in society,  if anyone not raise concern in right time after completion of 5 year w.r.t. 2020 . We need to live with existing conditions 

As per BBA upto 5 year builder will maintain the society
07/01/23, 4:43 pm - +91 99101 70875: Agreed .Now its time to get some concrete solution..
07/01/23, 4:49 pm - +91 99998 21063: My suggestion 
1st we can meet with @919818250395 ji. I hope they can put the proposal with Builder as they're in connect with builder as AO .
07/01/23, 4:51 pm - +91 95400 96333: Let residents take a call ‚Ä¶ we have suffered enough ‚Ä¶ we have to define the line ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs have opinion of others as well
07/01/23, 4:51 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Absolutely right every problem does not hv solution of doing protests only üôÇüëç
07/01/23, 4:53 pm - +91 99994 80107: The idea of doing protest for not having DG back in absence of grid while garp is implemented won't look good in front of relevant authorities! As they are simply following rule !  Better to have meeting with AO and Builder to resolve this
07/01/23, 4:53 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: When discussions , feedbacks and mutual concent can resolve the issue so I think we should plan things amicably.
07/01/23, 4:53 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Agreed üëç
07/01/23, 4:53 pm - +91 95400 96333: The ladies ‚Ä¶ the children ‚Ä¶ home working professionals and elderly have been pushed beyond the limit ‚Ä¶.maybe you don‚Äôt suffer .. so your call
07/01/23, 4:54 pm - +91 96505 64850: But what we are hearing from fmt is they can't do anything.. & If they don't agree with our AO then technically since maintenance is with  builder & JLL is only willing to listen to builder.  Then only power we have is of protest.. U go in fmt office they are not willing to listen to us.
07/01/23, 4:55 pm - +91 99994 80107: Again JLL is just following what their client is saying! We may have world top facilities management company here and they would be again following direction from builder! Have an RWA to resolve issue to some extent!
07/01/23, 4:55 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Who will pay penalty if rule is broken likewise Noone na so then whats the solution
07/01/23, 4:56 pm - +91 99994 80107: And how will.it look if we protest that builder is not breaking rule
07/01/23, 4:57 pm - +91 99994 80107: We all need to meet with builder find some middle way
07/01/23, 4:57 pm - +91 99994 80107: Find alternatives like PNG generator etc
07/01/23, 4:57 pm - +91 96505 64850: That's again the fmt & builder language it will be same thing as what 100 other societies are doing.. They can put big hope for tower I construction without getting all permission close 2nd gate and half societies.. Unke liye kahi penalty ni hota .
07/01/23, 4:58 pm - +91 96505 64850: We can collect all these problematic point & that can be our protest.. 3 other societies nearby no power cut in them..
07/01/23, 4:58 pm - +91 99998 21063: If you're available in society better plan to meet as residence and can discuss . Everything can not be possible to wright on whattsup.
07/01/23, 4:59 pm - +91 96505 64850: JLL itself managing 10 other societies no power cut in them.. Kaha unhone residents se paper pe liya hai .
07/01/23, 4:59 pm - +91 95400 96333: Can all residents meet at 1 pm
07/01/23, 4:59 pm - +91 99994 80107: Rule breakings are everywhere! How are other societies using generator! Protest aren't happening right ? So they must be doing something in balance with builder to make it work
07/01/23, 5:00 pm - +91 99994 80107: Is there RWA in other societies? Assuming yes ! So u have ur answer they have arrived at some common point and are using generator
07/01/23, 5:00 pm - +91 99998 21063: Possible 
We can call residence meeting whose interested can join . I am available
07/01/23, 5:01 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: I am in for meeting and finding solution not for Protest .
07/01/23, 5:02 pm - +91 96505 64850: Wahi to challenge hai na they are arriving at that understanding with us . Then we can make their life difficult as well
07/01/23, 5:02 pm - +91 99998 21063: Yes we will discuss the solution may some residence not active on whattsup they can give any better idea.
07/01/23, 5:02 pm - +91 95400 96333: Please let‚Äôs all meet up at 1 pm ‚Ä¶ the youngest above age of 21 can chair the meeting ‚Ä¶ I will attend ‚Ä¶ I would request all those who are suffering the ladies, the children and elderly ‚Ä¶ please attend and voice your concerns ‚Ä¶ regards

07/01/23, 5:04 pm - +91 95400 96333: Even this is welcome ‚Ä¶ but we must give everyone adequate notice ‚Ä¶ your proposal is welcome ‚Ä¶ let residents take a call ‚Ä¶. Regards
07/01/23, 5:11 pm - +91 99994 80107: I am in
07/01/23, 5:11 pm - +91 98104 11784: Hello Freinds,
I propose that a group of people meet Mr. Suresh Mallik (RO) as he is authority in premises right now & Along with Him then meet FMT officials.
 Mr. Suresh can order any descipline to Residents, FMT  as well as Builder. I am sure he will help. If this fails then we should gather in large no & find other ways. I am available tomorrow as its my son's B'day today. 

But ye problem ke liye hame hi kuchh karna padega ek saath otherwise it will never be solved.
07/01/23, 5:12 pm - +91 98104 11784: RO jo likh ke dega sabko manana padega ( thats the rule) & i am sure Suresh ji will be happy to write for residents üôèüòÄ
07/01/23, 5:13 pm - +91 99998 21063: Agree Raghu bro..

let's meet tomorrow for Gernal discussion
07/01/23, 5:14 pm - +91 99101 70875: Agreed
07/01/23, 5:14 pm - +91 95400 96333: Why a Group of people ‚Ä¶ why not ‚ÄúAll Resident meeting‚Äù
07/01/23, 5:16 pm - +91 98104 11784: Mera matlab "any group of people se tha" 

Rest people's call Avdesh Ji.
07/01/23, 5:17 pm - +91 95400 96333: The messaging matters ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a democratic group and everyone has equal right to communicate and express ‚Ä¶ they also have a right to be present or not ‚Ä¶ by the way I have met Mr Malik
07/01/23, 5:20 pm - +91 98104 11784: Completely agree with you Avdesh Ji. Hope this message was better in understanding ?
07/01/23, 5:20 pm - +91 98182 50395: I want to meet Advisory committee and pet policy committee to discuss further action,
They are advised to meet at 6.30 PM today,
07/01/23, 5:20 pm - +91 95607 77552: Why to give anything signed if other socities are not following it.. other socities are normally running 

Is it only Mapsko have special rules

We need to ask @919818250395 ji to strongly put this point in front of builder and FMT
07/01/23, 5:21 pm - +91 95607 77552: Last time it was told that DG will be given .. talks are being there ..
07/01/23, 5:22 pm - +91 95607 77552: And DG will be given when power cuts 

But again same situation
07/01/23, 5:24 pm - +91 95400 96333: Hasn‚Äôt the AC resigned ?
07/01/23, 5:25 pm - +91 95607 77552: It‚Äôs not happening na
So many time residents are talking on WhatsApp , asking Suresh Malik ji to pitch in, he is also talking with FMT and builder , residents are taking with FMT face to face 
But we are coming at the same stage ..
07/01/23, 5:28 pm - +91 95607 77552: We all are suffering .. and this time beyond limit

Every time same situation 

And penalty kaun dega and all
Builder is non compliant .. he does not have the DG set as per govt rules .. so he will have to find a solution 

Resident q penalty denge jab 1 lakh power back up ke mama pe die hai
07/01/23, 5:29 pm - +91 95607 77552: So much hard earned money gone into purchasing house here .. and then giving 1 lakh for power back up specially 

And then this is happening to us
07/01/23, 5:30 pm - +91 95607 77552: Is it Mapsko exclusive that other socities are running normally

Only Mapsko ke upar penalty hai

Plus no other society residents have given anything in written why should we

It‚Äôs builder duty to provide us electricity 
It‚Äôs basics
07/01/23, 5:31 pm - +91 95400 96333: Nothing will change if we don‚Äôt protest ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs close down Mapsko sales office at 12 noon tomorrow
07/01/23, 5:33 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: I am not saying madam ki who will pay my statement means ki plan FMT things with the officials so this burden won't impact us.
07/01/23, 5:34 pm - +91 98119 62583: I suggest that a  general body meeting be called urgently tomorrow afternoon invitation Mr Suresh Malik as A.O.n also as a resident, policy formation can wait but electricity is an  emergency n has to be solved immediately, hope people agree
07/01/23, 5:35 pm - +91 98119 62583: Inviting
07/01/23, 5:35 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: WFH is a normal scenario today and for that electricity is a basic need along with food cloth and homes üè°
07/01/23, 5:35 pm - +91 95607 77552: It should be FMT and builder
They are non compliant and they should take our responsibility 

Either they provide DG backup or they do some alternatives
07/01/23, 5:36 pm - +91 99100 77054: Correct Sir but even for that an opportunity through a meet is the primary protocol. Give the short notice and a big feel through a big gathering. They will know the next step. Rest as you all decide. I will be there at 12 tomorrow
07/01/23, 5:36 pm - +91 84477 31434: Instead of focusing on real problems, Guard in G tower ringing the door bells and asking people to remove your pots, thats what FMT is doing !
07/01/23, 5:37 pm - +91 99100 77054: üòÑüòÑ
07/01/23, 5:37 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: Ultimate ü§£ü§£ü§£
07/01/23, 5:38 pm - +91 84477 31434: There was one flower pot someone kept outside the door, in front of me he rang the bell and asked I am following FMT orders !
07/01/23, 5:38 pm - +91 95607 77552: I think the AC committee got dissolved

And we urge to have a meeting with all Residents .. it‚Äôs actually a very serious issue now 

Our work and office is getting impacted ..
07/01/23, 5:38 pm - Ankit Malik H2502 Mountville GGM: May be with plant organic khaad they are planning biogas plant for producing electricity üòú
07/01/23, 5:39 pm - +91 95400 96333: So 12 noon at Sales office of Mapsko ‚Ä¶ let them switch to CNG/PNG based DG set since they assured us 24x7 backup ‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs all meet there ‚Ä¶ later we will meet for all resident meet
07/01/23, 5:39 pm - +91 99100 77054: üëç
07/01/23, 5:41 pm - +91 95607 77552: My point is same
Give us anything DG back up, green DG back up whatever they can

Just give us electricity 

We have paid so much for buying a house and extra money for 24*7 power back up 

Now it‚Äôs their duty to provide us electricity 24*7
07/01/23, 5:43 pm - +91 95400 96333: We have to push Mapsko for our rights ‚Ä¶ else they won‚Äôt spend a penny ‚Ä¶ they have sold the flat and have no obligation

07/01/23, 6:33 pm - +91 96507 19060: The crux of the memo no. HSPCB/GRS/2022/581 dated 22.07.2022 addressed to Mapsko seems to be pointing out that *‚Äú‚Ä¶ as a developer you failed to install electricity infrastructure and you have no regular power connection from DHBVNL ...‚Äù*
¬†
*‚ÄúYou are therefore directed to develop internal and external electrical infrastructure till 15.08.2022 and ensure to eliminate dependency of the project on DG set and submit and action taken report in this regard at the earliest, failing which action against the defaulting shall be taken as per acts/rules/directions.‚Äù*
¬†
Any communication between 22.07.2022 and 15.08.2022 to justify the prevailing status and/or action-report with reference to the above-mentioned memo, if any, should help in getting exemption/extension etc.
07/01/23, 6:34 pm - +91 96507 19060: @919818250395 ji and All, the abovementioned message is what I posted on 29th Sep 2022. The memo no. HSPCB/GRS/2022/581 dated 22.07.2022 (posted below) referred therein needs to be addressed first, if not done already, to move forward. It goes without saying that we need to aim for long term solution(s) i.e., *Back-up which really Backs us up*

So basically this notice goes out to Societies having temp/inadequate load connection and are using DG as primary source for electricity.. So it should not apply to us now..

08/01/23, 11:51 am - +91 88005 87720: Also would request @919818250395 Sir to let know how long the discussion will go‚Ä¶it‚Äôs already been good 20-25 days since we have been hearing this‚Ä¶
08/01/23, 11:52 am - +91 88823 87521: Secondly. All of this switching dg on is a short term relief.

We should also be made aware by when will our society switch to green generators because grap will be applied every winter and green gensets are only permanent solution to this problem

08/01/23, 11:54 am - +91 95607 77552: Ok no problem 
We are just asking ki kya duration decide hua hai long cuts ka 

Atleast we can have the information if discussions going on 

@919818250395 can you please provide us more insight 

And jab ye sab decide ho raha hai toh FMT non availability of DG ka q nikal rha notice ?
08/01/23, 11:58 am - +91 95607 77552: Thik hai you cannot solve many problems on WhatsApp group 

Then can you please have an all resident meet today and tell us in details
What discussions have been done
What is the next plan
What will be the long duration
Time 
Why FMT is issuing notices time to time of non availability of DG backup
08/01/23, 11:58 am - +91 98118 81674: Thik hai sir. Nahi machayenge shor. Abhi ke liye aap ye bata dijiye ke ‚Äúlong cut‚Äù ka kya duration decide hua hai. 

Also will wait for your update after your meeting with Mohit Ji üôèüèºüôèüèº
08/01/23, 11:59 am - +91 98118 81674: Agar 1 ghanta bijli nahi ho aur Ramesh Malik sahab bolen ki abhi ‚Äúlong cut‚Äù nahi hai to phir kya karna hai wo bhi guide kar dijiye üôèüèºüôèüèº
08/01/23, 12:00 pm - +91 98182 50395: If there is long cut i can sometimes allow at risk
08/01/23, 12:00 pm - +91 98182 50395: But not always
08/01/23, 12:01 pm - +91 98182 50395: Above was sent by concerned
08/01/23, 12:03 pm - +91 88823 87521: This looks like we are at mercy of concerned
08/01/23, 12:03 pm - +91 88823 87521: Guys are we meeting at 12?
08/01/23, 12:04 pm - +91 95607 77552: @919818250395 ji 
Thanks for this 
Ok then what is the time they thought for long cut , duration? 

And our concerns remains the same .. it‚Äôs their duty to provide electricity 
So what is the plan they are doing for 24*7 back up

And he said not always .. so our concern is we want 24*7 electricity always
08/01/23, 12:04 pm - +91 95297 41496: Who is the ‚ÄúI‚Äù?
08/01/23, 12:04 pm - +91 95607 77552: Builder
08/01/23, 12:04 pm - +91 95607 77552: I guess
08/01/23, 12:05 pm - +91 98118 81674: Sneha basically koi resolution nahi hai.
08/01/23, 12:06 pm - +91 88823 87521: Yes. Looks like it
08/01/23, 12:06 pm - +91 99100 77054: No one here üò¢üò¢
08/01/23, 12:07 pm - +91 88823 87521: Cam cae bharte rahe. Benefits ke naam pr yeh sb bhi jhelle...

08/01/23, 12:07 pm - +91 95607 77552: Wohi toh
Ye toh bahut ehsaan wali baat hui 

Ki Han Kabhi kabhi kr denge
08/01/23, 12:08 pm - +91 88005 87720: I think the way we are dealing with this‚Ä¶ 
The dream with which the builder built this project to ‚ÄúProvide Resort type living‚Äù should be changed to ‚ÄúVillage Type Living‚Äù
08/01/23, 12:08 pm - +91 98509 58858: Alot of people are working from home, bahut se senior citizens hain society mein and alot of infants as well. There can be other critical situation as well. DG cut ke long duration matlab kitna kisi ke liye 15 min bhi long ho sakta hai and builders ke liye 6 ghante bhi na long hours ho. Clarity is all that is being seeked here
08/01/23, 12:09 pm - +91 97116 40636: I am in front of sales office
08/01/23, 12:10 pm - +91 95607 77552: I mean the concerns are same

How other socities getting DG back up
What is the plan for next 6 months to get green DG back up .. 
and kab tak aise andhere ke rahenge hum 


Agar DG nahi de sakte toh kuch alternative do as it‚Äôs their duty
They are non compliant not us 

@919818250395 ji none of our these concerns are answered anywhere , neither you are doing any meeting with residents to give assurance and insight on this topic
08/01/23, 12:12 pm - +91 98113 04666: If we are not getting power backup why FMT is allowed to use it , they should also sit without power in these winters and their work should also suffer.
08/01/23, 12:12 pm - +91 95607 77552: And this is sometimes 
Not always 
Toh kya mercy to mercy unke hume electricity milegi @919818250395 ji? 

Ye kesa jawaab tha inka
08/01/23, 12:14 pm - +91 88823 87521: Is it sales office/ club house?
08/01/23, 12:15 pm - +91 95828 06249: Can someone share the contact number of dry cleaners who comes in MMV
08/01/23, 12:17 pm - +91 99716 67972: @919818250395 sir.. if govt imposes fine on long usage of DG then.. who will bear that cost? Would that be implied in residents or builder will do?
08/01/23, 12:19 pm - +91 88823 87521: There is noone at sales office
08/01/23, 12:19 pm - +91 99716 67972: Cz anyways builder has to think about the dg conversion, we all were promised 100 percent power backup so to fulfill that builder has to come into action for residents not against them

Dear Sir, 

In accordance with the BBA residents at Mountville were to be provided 24x7 power back up by the builder 

Due to GRAP and other unscheduled power outages the DGs are not being run by the FMT quoting directives by the management 

We request for a permanent solution to the problem which requires conversion of existing DGs to PNG based Generators which is the only permanent solution 

Non availability of power for 2-3 hours frequently is causing severe health and work related issues especially for infants, elderly and those working from home 

Would request the Mapsko management to kindly favourably consider our proposal and undertake the conversion of DGs to PNG 

With regards
08/01/23, 1:35 pm - +91 99710 22503: Yes, apne mein bhi aa hi jayenge
08/01/23, 1:38 pm - +91 99100 77054: I think the suggestion to convert to PNG should come from him or else he will ask us to shell out each penny as it would be considered our proposal. Rest as majority suggests
08/01/23, 1:39 pm - +91 99995 00775: <Media omitted>
08/01/23, 1:40 pm - +91 95400 96333: Kindly also add : 

The conversion to PNG is being undertaken by IGL and is likely to considerably bring down the operational costs

08/01/23, 1:43 pm - +91 72763 03938: Agree! This should be clearly described that Mapsko management has to convert it and no cost will be borne by residents
08/01/23, 1:43 pm - +91 72763 03938: We have already paid them enough. No More Now!!
08/01/23, 2:24 pm - +91 95400 96333: As suggested please replace the word PNG with ‚ÄúGreen Generator ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ you may write individual emails to the Mapsko management ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs have 24x7 power in Mapsko Mountville‚Ä¶. Regards

09/01/23, 8:20 am - +91 88005 87720: @919818250395 Ji is this power cut under the long duration power cut to provide DG back up???
Highly irritating we need to get ready for office and this power cut with no DG back up‚Ä¶
Pathetic
09/01/23, 8:21 am - +91 99710 22503: Not bad timing, it is bad situation for all actually
09/01/23, 8:21 am - +91 98737 20770: @919818250395 ji, pls ask FMT to start DG, we all are getting late for our offices..

09/01/23, 8:23 am - +91 88008 16147: Is this a power failure from backend? @919871989782 could you please confirm?
09/01/23, 8:26 am - +91 88005 87720: I think they are taking advantage of our not standing together‚Ä¶
We should stop making them payment for the maintenance and common area charges which is due date bound so that they also fee the heat.. then only they might start listening to us‚Ä¶But again if all unite in this then only things might work‚Ä¶

09/01/23, 9:23 am - +91 99710 22503: Really very pathetic situation. Instead of improvement, the situation in Mapsko Mountville is degrading day by day and we are only hearing only  assurance from governing body

09/01/23, 9:29 am - +91 99100 77054: Exactly. Administrater is there to facilitate election. RWA only can talk to authorities. Election is the solution as they only can seriously take up the issue with Management and the EB

09/01/23, 9:56 am - +91 88007 62986: The only solution is we need have our elected RWA in place and above all we all need to stand united and stop paying them unless this issue is completely resolved

Suggest, we raise citizen grievance in the cpgrams portal....they will have to listen and respond ....but they do that only when bulk complaints are rec'd..
. That atleast most of us can do from home...
09/01/23, 2:05 pm - +91 99994 80107: Certainly we all are locals now ! They must exempt us
09/01/23, 2:06 pm - +91 99994 80107: Let's raise This grievance in bulk so that it gets addressed
09/01/23, 2:06 pm - +91 70301 19007: This same thing happened with me. They were saying exemptions are for land owned not for Flat owners!!
09/01/23, 2:07 pm - +91 99994 80107: They told me exemption is for villages around not the sectors
09/01/23, 2:07 pm - +91 98975 20593: As per toll operator definition of local is the one's who have given land while thie new gurgoan was coking up and not us it was strange for me aswell

10/01/23, 8:52 am - +91 95607 77552: You are right 
Even RWA will have problems and will have their own rules which people will have problem on.. 

First People got so much enraged because electricity is basic and our day to day operations and many work depend on it including our office work .. and till now I have never seen people said anything against you .. they all are supporting you and reaching out to you for help .. and tagging you to help us 


Secondly regarding the committee and rules and other policies , there were few rules majority of the residents did not like it and they put their opposition.. and it‚Äôs not like only the people opposing were aggressive .. you need to see the reason behind it why people got upset
10/01/23, 8:53 am - +91 95607 77552: The rules were made and published on FMT without resident discussion etc. so then the people started panicking and questioning.. you have to see resident side also and root cause why people came in opposition 

And not only committee side, as they also say a lot of things or make policies which resident feel not comfortable at
10/01/23, 8:54 am - +91 95607 77552: But I again say people always stood by you and reached to you for help .. as electricity is a very scary situation people rushed you for help
10/01/23, 9:26 am - +91 95400 96333: Would request if you could elucidate the decision rather than ‚ÄúWork in Progress‚Äù kind of status reports which does not mean anything ‚Ä¶ we are all in support of you ‚Ä¶ regards

Most Geysers have this power trip/reset button , in few it is behind atleast a screw.. & Most of the times it's tripped & just pressing/resetting it fixes it. If that's the issue u will have to find where it is in your model & urself can do it.. Switch off reset, close screw and then turn on to check..

10/01/23, 9:55 pm - +91 99996 71205: I am owner of Flat No. H-503, Mapsko Mount Ville. Currently, my flat is available for to let. 

This is just to bring to everyone‚Äôs notice that today there had been a very concerning security breach in society. Some random person was given access inside the society & my flat without my knowledge. Though I had received the request for the same on my gate app and I had declined as I did not identify the person. Still, the person was allowed inside society. When I realised someone has accessed my flat and therefore I raised the issue with the security/maintenance team then they said he was allowed because he claimed he is my new tenant whereas I never gave them any such information either in writing or verbally. This person got inside with the intent to stay there as a tenant. 

And just to reinforce the fact that all this happened when there is such a big team to maintain peace & order in society. 

It's very disturbing matter because if this can happen to us then it can happen to any of the residents of the society in future too.
10/01/23, 9:56 pm - +91 70228 88847: This needs special attention from security for multiple reasons. This is very bad.
10/01/23, 10:07 pm - +91 97390 09182: Dear All, we are in the process of hiring sr solution architect with +18 years of experience in contact center solutions or transformation. Please let me know if you would like to refer someone.

10/01/23, 11:13 pm - +91 99963 76383: by all this you can identify who has done fraud with you

10/01/23, 11:23 pm - +91 88027 71414: Access inside society is not a big deal, boundary walls are scalable, door behind genset, revenue roads etc.
10/01/23, 11:29 pm - +91 99996 71205: But unfortunately that was not the case guy got inside through entry gate
10/01/23, 11:30 pm - +91 99996 71205: Allowed by security guards
10/01/23, 11:30 pm - +91 88027 71414: Ok, and who shared Flat keys / passcode?
10/01/23, 11:32 pm - +91 99996 71205: I shared it with broker as flat was available for to let. Maybe he got it from him.
10/01/23, 11:34 pm - +91 98115 01899: Then bigger issue was with the broker also who without your knowledge took the tenant to the house
11/01/23, 7:08 am - +91 99583 38541: Major issue.... please blacklist this broker too... n according to me ... kindly change your entrance lock ...

11/01/23, 7:38 am - +91 97116 40636: Security laps .Once the request has been declined on my gate then how they permitted to enter inside only by referring "tenant". Before permitting , security staff  should have contacted to you.

11/01/23, 9:42 am - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: Not sure what and which agency our FMT uses to dispose of garbage?? Are we all segregating our waste at source??
11/01/23, 9:46 am - +91 98509 58858: I moved in recently in the society and I kept the garbage segregated as set and dry. But when I asked the person who comes to collect garbage  he said mixed hi le jaate hain hum.. So what is the norm here exactly I wonder
11/01/23, 9:51 am - +91 98370 76788: <Media omitted>
11/01/23, 9:52 am - +91 88027 71414: So garbage segregation by agencies is also a money making business. Reason they want mix garbage and segregate and charge corporation.
11/01/23, 10:03 am - +91 99100 77054: Exactly. We bought a bin with separate columns for wet n dry. But the collector has no idea
11/01/23, 10:04 am - +91 99100 77054: And this sells for a good price
11/01/23, 10:05 am - +91 99101 74552: I have separate bins for both dry and wet. There has to be awareness in garbage collectors and separate bins for collecting as well if they are not.
11/01/23, 10:07 am - +91 99101 74552: In most of the good societies, there is a service organization helping in implementation
11/01/23, 10:22 am - +91 98509 58858: This is how Indore initiated it's spree in cleanliness when they started with this basic mechanism of segregation of waste some 7 years ago, all wet waste is now used for composting and is used for plants which are adopted by corporates. Collector himself would audit mixed wastes and now it's a way of living for alot of cities such as Indore, Surat, Pune etc.
11/01/23, 10:56 am - +91 83908 60077: The residents can put efforts and segregate the waste at source but we need assurance that our efforts don't go in vain and the collected waste doesn't get mixed once it leaves our doorstep.
11/01/23, 11:11 am - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: Exactly
11/01/23, 11:14 am - Eshwaran VRK A204 Mountville GGM: Two things on it:
Only segregated waste at source;
No segregation after collecting from flat;
Straight disposal from MMV to mCG authorised collection agency;
This will help in keeping our basement clean and hygiene and no health hazard to residents
